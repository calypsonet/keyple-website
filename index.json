This openness has already been a reality for several years in the field of passenger information and has enabled the explosion of rich and high-quality applications, thanks in particular to Open Data. Today, Eclipse Keypleâ¢ is paving the way for ticketing to follow the same path, by making available for free the first fully Open Source API.\nEclipse Keypleâ¢ accelerates the integration and development of ticketing applications by enabling multimodal transport services, public transport operators and event organizers to implement ticketing and access control systems based on a common, open and modular base.\nEclipse Keypleâ¢ works with Keyple\u0026rsquo;s extensions. The first available extension allows you to benefit from CalypsoÂ®'s main features of reliability, security and interoperability.\nEclipse Keypleâ¢ transforms complex contactless ticketing, transportation and event access systems into a simple integration to manage terminal readers and portals that use smart cards and mobile applications to enter and exit.\nAs an open source technology, Eclipse Keypleâ¢ offers uniformity of structure but does not lock you into a specific ticketing system.

For example, a smart card reader could be a terminal, a portable scanning laser gun, or a swipe tablet area that is embedded into a door, vehicle or gate. Code is written for a terminal to set the parameters for allowing cards or apps to transmit ticketing information data. Sometimes in a distributed architecture system design, the code for the reader is not on the terminal, but in a cloud environment, so the reader sends the data to cloud-based architecture. Ticketing application: This is behind-the-scenes code that is able to take the data from the smart card reader and, in milliseconds real-time, analyze the balance of the ticket, confirm the permissions for entry, and update the data on the ticket (for example, to confirm that the ticket holder can enter the gate or vehicle, and then to deduct the cost of the journey and calculate the new balance).  According to this scheme, Keypleâ¢ defines two layers:\n Smart Card readers are integrated through plugins implementing the SE Proxy API which manages the communications with a smart card through any type of contactless or contact reader (local, remote, standard, proprietaryâ¦) Ticketing applications relies on a high-level CalypsoÂ® processing API to manage CalypsoÂ® commands \u0026amp; security features. This API uses the SE Proxy API to communicate with the reader  Keypleâ¢ comes with dedicated plugins that integrate directly with smart card readers that have been built on standard software interfaces including PC/SC, Android NFC reader, and Android OMAPI.\nIn cases where there is a distributed architecture design, Keypleâ¢ includes a Remote API plugin so that a smart card terminal can be operated remotely, as if it were local to the terminal, and ensures that robust security and speed is not sacrificed in a cloud-based system.\nThe Calypso Processing API is also available as a Keypleâ¢ extension. This component carries out the terminal processing element of ticketing technology. Access to Calypsoâs security features are automatically managed by the Keypleâ¢ extension.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1607964312,"objectID":"bf786b8ea9088ea228a979a08534bfca","permalink":"/keyple-website/what-is-keyple/main-features/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/keyple-website/what-is-keyple/main-features/","section":"what-is-keyple","summary":"Keyple makes contactless ticketing accessible.","tags":null,"title":"Keyple's main features","type":"what-is-keyple"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The API is currently divided in two major layers:\n The âKeyple Core' : a Secure Element Proxy API which allows managing SE readers in a generic way, whaterver the reader driver or environment, and for standalone or distributed solution ( Keyple Core User Guide).

(Please refer to this file for more information).\nAlthough symlink support should be provided out of the box for Unix users, Windows users should be aware that the git option core.symlinks needs to be enabled before cloning this repo. Several solutions can be considered:\n When installing git for Windows, an option Enable symbolic links can be choosen. If it has not been enabled and you want to set it via the installer, a reinstallation is needed If you do not want to reinstall git, this option can be enabled afterward via the command line git config core.symlinks true Also, the option can be enabled once only for this specific cloning operation with git clone -c core.symlinks=true REPO_URL  It is important to note that for this option to be actually working, the Windows user needs to have the SeCreateSymbolicLink permission: a user with admin rights is typically granted with this permission.\nImport keyple components with Gradle When using gradle, it is fairly simple to import Keyple components into your project.

Otherwise if the reader is âobservableâ, the operating of a âdefault selectionâ: in this case a default selection request is defined on the reader, the terminal observes the reader, and wait to be notified by the reader about a SE insertion and selection.  At the end the terminal gets a selected SE, it can follow by operating APDU commands with the selected SE until the communication channel is kept open.\nThen a Keyple Core extension could be used to operates APDU commands with the selected SE solution.\n The Keyple Calypso extension provides a high-level API to defined ticketing processing involving Calypso cards, cf.: âKeyple Calypso User Guideâ.\n Secure Element Proxy Service API â readers management Using the Keyple Core, Secure Element Readers (SeReader) are managed through plugins (ReaderPlugin).\nThe active plugins are registered to the SE Proxy Service (the singleton SeProxyService).\n Each plugin is registered through a unique name to the SE Proxy Service. Each reader of a plugin is also defined with a unique name inside the plugin.  Plugin setting To secure the usage of the SE Proxy API for the development of terminal applications, the internal implementation of plugins (classes SpecificPluginImpl \u0026amp; SpecificReaderImpl) is hidden.\n For a specific plugin, only the plugin \u0026amp; reader interfaces (SpecificPlugin \u0026amp; SpecificReader) and the factory (class SpecificPluginFactory) are public. The factory of a plugin is set to register a specific plugin to the SE Proxy Service.  Most of plugins of local readers of Keyple are defined as singleton with a unique instance (e.g.: PC/SC, Android NFC, Android OMAPI, most of embedded readers).\nFor the Remote SE plugin defined to manage remote readers, specific plugin instances are created for each communication interfaces.\nSE readersâ access The SE Proxy Service allows to get all the list of the active plugins. A specific plugin could also be directly recovered through its name.\nIn the same way, a plugin can provide the list of all the plugged readers.\nDepending on the native reader technology, some specific parameters could be defined at the plugin or reader level.\nFor a classic plugin, the number of readers is determinate, all the plugged readers of the plugin are directly available for the SE Proxy Service.\nSupport of reader farm or HSM For systems based on a centralized security, in order to manage multiple remote terminal in parallel, central servers could requires to interface a huge number (several hundreds or thousands) of SE through a farm of readers or HSM (Hardware Security Module: an electronic board able to emulate multiple SE).\n The multitude of embedded SE could be divided in different groups of profiles. An HSM is often shared between several services, so the full set of readers isn\u0026rsquo;t directly available for a service, a service has to request the allocation of a reader from a specific group.  The SE Proxy Service could support reader farm or HSM though plugins managing \u0026ldquo;pool\u0026rdquo; of readers (ReaderPoolPlugin).\n At the initialization, the list of reader is empty. The list is be filled depending on the reader allocations requested. When not more required, a reader could be released from the pool.  All plugins have to implement the interface ReaderPlugin and SeReader. A plugin managing a pool of reader should implement in addition the interface ReaderPoolPlugin.\nSE presence check \u0026amp; âexplicit selection transactionâ A SE reader has the capability to check is a SE is present or not.\n For SE terminal processing for which the presence of a SE in a reader is \u0026ldquo;static' during a transaction, the transaction starts in general with the verification of the SE presence. If the SE is present, the transaction can continue with the selection of the SE. We call this kind of transaction: an \u0026ldquo;explicit selection transaction\u0026rdquo;.\n Plugin \u0026amp; Reader events For some SE terminal, the processing is dynamically driven by the insertion/remove of a SE in a reader, or by the plug/unplug of a reader.\nE.g., in transportation, the ticketing transaction of access control gates is often started when a contactless card is detected in the field of the reader. For that, in Keyple, a SE reader or a plugin has to be observable.\nA plugin could be optionally observable (by implementing ObservablePlugin).\n In this case a terminal application could observe the plugin (by implementing PluginObserver) in order to be notified (PluginEvent) when a new reader is plugged to the plugin, or when a referenced reader is unplugged. To receive the notification of a specific plugin, the plugin observer should first be added to the observer list of the observable plugin.  Depending on the capability of the plugin, a reader could be optionally observable (by implementing ObservableReader).\n A terminal application could observe the plugin (by implementing ReaderObserver) in order to be notified (ReaderEvent) when a SE is inserted or removed from a specific. The reader observer should be added to the observer list to receive the notifications the observable reader.  By default, an observable reader notifies only the insertion or the remove of a SE.\nPlugin observability activation An observable plugin automatically starts to observe plugin events when at least one plugin observer is registered and stops the listening when the last plugin observer is removed.\nAutomatic selection \u0026amp; âdefault selection transactionâ On an observable reader, there is in addition the possibility to define a \u0026ldquo;default selection operation\u0026rdquo;: in this case, when a SE is inserted, the observable reader tries automatically to select the inserted SE using the defined default setting.\n If the inserted SE is successfully selected, then the observable reader notifies that \u0026ldquo;an inserted SE has matched the default selection\u0026rdquo; and provides the corresponding response. Otherwise if the observable reader failed to select the inserted SE, it could just notify that a SE has been inserted.   For SE terminal for which the processing is \u0026ldquo;dynamically\u0026rdquo; driven by the presence of a SE in a reader, the transaction starts in general with the detection of the insertion of a SE and its automatic selection. The reader observer is then notified to analyze the response of the selected SE, and to continue the transaction with the SE. We call this kind of transaction: a \u0026ldquo;default selection transaction\u0026rdquo;.\n Reader notification modes If no default selection is defined, an observable reader notifies its observers for âSE insertionâ (whatever the SE detected) or âSE removedâ events. A default selection could be defined for the âalwaysâ or the \u0026ldquo;matched onlyâ notification mode.\n In the always mode, if the inserted matches the default selection, the observers are notified about a âSE matchedâ event, otherwise an âSE insertionâ event is notified. In case of \u0026ldquo;matched onlyâ mode, the observable reader doesnât notify SE insertion event. The reader observer will be notified only if a default selection succeed on the observable reader; this configuration allows the reader observer to skip the processing of wrong SE insertions.  Reader observability activation, âpolling modeâ \u0026amp; âSE removal procedureâ For an observable reader, the listening of reader event requires also the registration of at least one reader observer.\nAn observable reader could switch between four internal states: âWait for start detectionâ, âWait for SE insertionâ, âWait for SE processingâ, âWait for SE removalâ.\n At the wait for start detection, the observable reader doesnât notify any event. The start of the SE detection by an observable reader need to be explicitly requested by an observer by setting a âpolling modeâ either through a âstartSeDetectionâ or a âsetDefaultSelectionRequestâ commands. The SE detection could be started for polling mode defined either in âsingle shotâ or ârepeatingâ mode.  In single shot mode, the observable reader stops the detection after the SE removal (back to the wait for start detection). In repeating mode, after the SE removal, the observable reader restart to detect another SE (back to the wait for SE insertion).   Wait for SE insertion, if a SE is inserted or selected, the registered reader observers are notified by the observable reader according to the defined notification mode. The observable reader switches to the wait for SE processing. During the SE processing by the observers, the observable reader waits that an observer acknowledges the end of the SE processing. There are two waits to ends the processing of an observed SE:  Either an observer directly could stop the listening of the observable reader (âstopSeDetectionâ command). The observable reader switches to the wait for start detection, and the observers are immediately notified about the SE remove. Otherwise, the observers could wait for a clean remove of the SE from the observable reader; itâs the SE removal sequence:  When the main reader observer has finished the processing of the SE, it could request the observable reader to wait for the remove of the SE (ânotifySeProcessedâ command). Finally, the reader observers could be notified when the SE is effectively removed. If the SE insertion listening started in the \u0026ldquo;repeating polling mode\u0026rdquo;, then when the SE is removed, the observable reader automatically starts again the listening of a new SE insertion; otherwise a new explicit request to start the SE listening is required to restart the listening.      Secure Element Selection API Selection parameters (Communication protocol, ATR, AID) To select a Secure Element, a SE Selector has to be defined, based on one to three parameters.\n A SE selection could be defined for a specific communication protocol. A SE could be filtered for an ATR (Answer To Reset) matching a specific regular expression. A specific application of a SE could be selected by setting its AID (Application IDentifier).  Selection transaction To operate a transaction with a SE, it should be firstly selected. The aim of the SE selection API is to get a SE resource: a set of a reader with a selected SE.\nA SE Selection is managed in two steps:\n first the âpreparationsâ of selection request based on SE selector, next the âprocessingâ of the selection requests.  In order to manage multiple kinds of SE, several selection requests could be prepared with different selectors.\nDepending on the setting of the reader, the processing of the selection could be operated in two different ways:\n either in a âexplicitâ way after the checking of the SE presence, or in a âdefaultâ way for an observable reader detecting the insertion of a SE.   cf. âGeneric Use Case 1 / Explicit AID Selectionâ example\ncf. âGeneric Use Case 2 / Default Selection Notificationâ example\n In case a SE Selection is prepared with a channel control mode defined as âkeep openâ, then the different prepared selectors are operated with the presented SE, but the processing of the selection stops when a selector matches the SE.\n The result of the SE selection could be a single âmatching SEâ: this SE is kept as selected in the reader. Itâs possible to directly operate command with the SE.  But if a SE selection has been defined with a channel control mode at âclose afterâ, in this case all the prepared SE selectors are operated whatever the matching result.\n After each selector processing, if a selector has matched, the logical channel with the SE is closed (the SE is no more selected). If several applications of the presented SE have matched the selectors: the result of the processing of SE selections is a list matching SE, but all of them are deselected. To continue the SE processing, the terminal application has to choose one matching SE, and to select it again but in âkeep openâ channel control mode.   cf. âGeneric Use Case 3 / Grouped Multi-Selectionâ example\n After the selection of a SE, using a SE resource, the terminal can continue by operating a specific transaction with the corresponding SE.\n cf. âGeneric Use Case 4 / Sequential Multi-Selectionâ example\n ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1603814711,"objectID":"ab9ddb1d301e4f8e2308e0076ac779a6","permalink":"/keyple-website/docs/architecture/keyple-core/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/keyple-website/docs/architecture/keyple-core/","section":"docs","summary":"This high-level API is convenient for developers implementing smart card processing application for terminal interfaced with smart card readers.\nPackages \u0026amp; features The Keyple Core User API is a tool to manage readers, and to select âgenericâ Secure Elements.","tags":null,"title":"Keyple Core Architecture","type":"book"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Packages \u0026amp; features The Keyple Calypso User API is an extension of the Keyple Core User API to manage Calypso Portable Object securely using Calypso SAM:\n The generic Secure Element selection is enhanced for the selection of a Calypso PO.

A request for a SE selection is defined with SE selector containing at least an AID (to operate through a Select Application APDU command) or an ATR filter. A request for a PO selection could be enhanced to operate after the PO selector processing some APDU commands with the PO : Select File or Read Records commands. In case of successful Calypso PO, the matching SE is retuned as a Calypso PO. The Calypso API analyzes the startup information of a Calypso PO in order to identify the kind of product, its revision, the optional features supported, the file structure used. Then for coming PO commands, the setting of the technical parameters automatically managed.  The PO command grouped with the PO selection have to be âpreparedâ before the processing of a default or explicit SE selection.\n cf. âCalypso Use Case 1 / Explicit AID Selectionâ example\ncf. âCalypso Use Case 2 / Default Selection Notificationâ example\n A âPO resourceâ is the set of a Calypso PO and the reader on which it is selected.\nIn a same way the Calypso APO provides the tool to select a Calypso security module (a SAM). A SAM selector doesnât support AID. The corresponding matching SE is a Calypso SAM. A Calypso SAM and the reader used for its selection defines a âSAM resourceâ.\nCalypso secure transaction A PO transaction could be operated on a Calypso resource. In case a SAM resource is set, a PO transaction could support the Calypso secure session in order to manage a mutual authentication between the terminal and the Calypso PO.\nThrough the PO transaction API, only the APDU commands for the PO are explicitly defined; the APDU commands for the SAM are automatically built by the library. Two kinds of methods are provided by the API: âprepareâ methods, and âprocessâ methods.\n The âprepareâ methods allows to define PO file selection and PO data access operations (read or update of records for a specific file, append of record for a cyclic file, increase or decrease of the value of a counter). A âprocessâ method sends to the PO at least the previously prepared command.  The process PO commands method could operated only if no secure session is currently open with the PO. If one or several PO commands have been prepared, a single request is done to the PO reader. The process opening method allows to manage the opening of a secure session.  First a single request is operated to the SAM reader in order to set the PO serial as the cryptographic diversifier, and to get the terminal challenge for the session. Then another single request is done to the PO reader to play the prepared PO command, and to manage the opening of the PO session.   A process PO command in session method could be processed only if a secure session is already open with PO.  A single request Is operated with the PO reader to operate the prepared PO commands. Another single request is sent to the SAM reader to update the update the digest of the MAC session.   The process closing method is used to manage the closing of the secure session with the PO.  A first SAM request is operated to update the digest of the last prepared PO commands and to get the terminal session certificate (to save a PO request, the API anticipates the responses of the prepared PO commands). A single PO request is transmitted to run the last prepared PO command, to recover the PO session certificate, and to send the ratification signal if necessary. Finally, a second SAM request allows to authenticate the PO. If the transaction is successful the mutual authentication is valid, and the PO has atomically committed the requested data updates.      The minimal costs of a Calypso secure session are:\n 3 PO requests (1 for the PO selection + 1 for the PO session opening + 1 for the PO session closing). And 3 SAM requests if the SAM is already selected (1 for the PO session opening + 2 for the PO session closing); otherwise 4 SAM requests if the SAM isnât already selected.  By default, the PO transaction manages the Calypso secure session as âatomicâ: the cumulative amount of PO updates command canât exceed the size of the PO session buffer.\n cf. âCalypso Use Case 4 / PO Authenticationâ example\n The PO transaction could also be defined to allow multiple sessions: in this case the transaction is automatically split in several session as necessary.\n cf. âCalypso Use Case 5 / PO Multiple Session\u0026quot; example\n ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1603814711,"objectID":"dbd01d0e9390470da13203692a071540","permalink":"/keyple-website/docs/architecture/keyple-calypso/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/keyple-website/docs/architecture/keyple-calypso/","section":"docs","summary":"Packages \u0026amp; features The Keyple Calypso User API is an extension of the Keyple Core User API to manage Calypso Portable Object securely using Calypso SAM:\n The generic Secure Element selection is enhanced for the selection of a Calypso PO.","tags":null,"title":"Keyple Calypso Architecture","type":"book"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" This quick start describes how to create a ready-to-execute Java command-line application that runs a simple Calypso card-based transaction involving two readers.\n The demonstration application created for this quick start requires a Calypo card and a Calypo SAM.

FAQ How do I find out the names of the readers?\nTo find out the names of the readers connected to your computer, we will use Keyple with the following class which prints in the console the number and names of the readers present:\nimport org.eclipse.keyple.core.service.Plugin; import org.eclipse.keyple.core.service.SmartCardService; import org.eclipse.keyple.plugin.pcsc.PcscPluginFactory; import java.util.Set; public class ReaderDiscovery { public static void main(String[] args) { SmartCardService smartCardService = SmartCardService.getInstance(); Plugin plugin = smartCardService.registerPlugin(new PcscPluginFactory()); Set\u0026lt;String\u0026gt; names = plugin.getReaderNames(); System.out.println(names.size() + \u0026quot; readers found.\u0026quot;); for (String name : names) { System.out.println('\u0026quot;' + name + '\u0026quot;'); } } }  The console output should look something like:\n2 readers found. \u0026quot;ASK LoGO 0\u0026quot; \u0026quot;Identive CLOUD 2700 R Smart Card Reader 0\u0026quot;  Identify which reader will be the PO (contactless) reader and the SAM (contact) reader and replace PO_READER_NAME and SAM_READER_NAME with their values.\nHow to activate the Keyple\u0026rsquo;s logs?\nAs soon as the slf4j library is imported into the project, Keyple modules are able to produce logs.\nHowever, to take full advantage of the possibilities of this library, it is necessary to create a simplelogger.properties file in the /src/main/resources folder of the project.\nThe self-documented content of this file may be:\n# SLF4J's SimpleLogger configuration file # Simple implementation of Logger that sends all enabled log messages, for all defined loggers, to System.err. # Default logging detail level for all instances of SimpleLogger. # Must be one of (\u0026quot;trace\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;debug\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;info\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;warn\u0026quot;, or \u0026quot;error\u0026quot;). # If not specified, defaults to \u0026quot;info\u0026quot;. org.slf4j.simpleLogger.defaultLogLevel=debug # Logging detail level for a SimpleLogger instance named \u0026quot;xxxxx\u0026quot;. # Must be one of (\u0026quot;trace\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;debug\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;info\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;warn\u0026quot;, or \u0026quot;error\u0026quot;). # If not specified, the default logging detail level is used. #org.slf4j.simpleLogger.log.xxxxx= # Set to true if you want the current date and time to be included in output messages. # Default is false, and will output the number of milliseconds elapsed since startup. org.slf4j.simpleLogger.showDateTime=true # The date and time format to be used in the output messages. # The pattern describing the date and time format is the same that is used in java.text.SimpleDateFormat. # If the format is not specified or is invalid, the default format is used. # The default format is yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss:SSS Z. org.slf4j.simpleLogger.dateTimeFormat=[HH:mm:ss:SSS] # Set to true if you want to output the current thread name. # Defaults to true. org.slf4j.simpleLogger.showThreadName=true # Set to true if you want the Logger instance name to be included in output messages. # Defaults to true. org.slf4j.simpleLogger.showLogName=false # Set to true if you want the last component of the name to be included in output messages. # Defaults to false. org.slf4j.simpleLogger.showShortLogName=true org.slf4j.simpleLogger.levelInBrackets=true  Why do I see a warning in the console about illegal reflexive access when running the application?\nA known problem on Windows 8/10 platforms causes the smartcard service to stop when the last reader is removed. This problem prevents a \u0026ldquo;classic\u0026rdquo; monitoring of connections and disconnections of readers with the smartcard.io library (Java PC/SC). So for the moment we are using a workaround based on reflexivity to overcome this problem and allow a correct monitoring of the readers in the PC/SC plugin. This has the disadvantage of generating a warning message with recent versions of the JVM.

Keyple could also be used to develop an application reading SmartCard content through NFC using Android NFC.\n  As Keyple request low level reader access, the key features of Keyple SDK relies on components called \u0026lsquo;Plugins\u0026rsquo;. These are the plugins that allow access to the hardware functionality of the terminal by using the native Android SDK or the terminal manufacturer\u0026rsquo;s own custom SDKs.\nThis guide will describe how to start a ticketing application using Keyple SDK and Android NFC plugin to read the content of a Calypso SmartCard. As we want to focus on Keyple integration, the Android application architecture will remain the simplest as possible.\nWhat to we need for this guide?

The reader concept also applies to the hardware interfaces used to communicate with security elements such as SAMs (Secure Access Modules), which are sometimes integrated into devices and the virtual interfaces represented by the remote implementations.\n[link to the detailed description of the reader related classes]\nPlugin In Keyple language a plugin is a service that allows the management of readers of a certain type. The plugin is responsible for informing the application about the availability of readers. The readers of the same plugin are usually hardware linked to the same physical interface.\nDepending on its profile, an application may use different types of plugins to communicate with the different elements it needs (card, SAM).\nThe Plugin interface essentially allows to list and retrieve the available readers.\n[link to the detailed description of the plugin related classes]\nSmart card service This is the Keyple Core service that concentrates the knowledge of active plugins and readers.\nAt startup, a Keyple application must register the plugins it uses. Conversely, it can also unregister them.\nThe SmartCardService will then make sure that the resources used are properly released.\n[link to the detailed description of the reader related classes]\nObservation The observation concept applies to readers as well as to plugins; optional, it is used depending on the needs.\nIt consists in monitoring changes such as reader connection/disconnection or card insertion/removal and informing the observing application through a dedicated interface.\nNot all plugins and readers are observable.\nSelection In Keyple the concept of selection is derived from the application selection defined by the ISO7816-4 standard.\nIt supplements it by managing cards that do not have the standard command using identification mechanisms based on Answer To Reset and the communication protocol, and also by allowing the execution of commands immediately following application selection or detection.\nThis principle optimizes the processing by allowing the application to elaborate advanced card discovery requests.\nSeveral targets can be defined by the application according to the different customer cards expected.\nThe default selection principle consists in providing an observable reader with a set of selection cases corresponding to the expected cards and receiving notifications containing not only the card identification but also the result of all additional commands that the application will have attached.\nAbstract smart card The abstract smart card concept is used by specific extensions (e.g. Keyple Calypso) and by the Keyple Core selection mechanism. It corresponds to an abstract container model implemented by the extension specific to a card type and returned by the selection process.\nThis container will be able to carry all the useful information known about the card.\nNote: this concept, mentioned here for understanding, should not appear to the application developer if he uses a card extension.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1607714088,"objectID":"75da7a7b55da55c41fc1cb8fc8f8d35b","permalink":"/keyple-website/docs/developer-guide/common-concepts/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/keyple-website/docs/developer-guide/common-concepts/","section":"docs","summary":"This page describes the core elements of Keyple, i.e. the concepts and APIs of Keyple Core that are used to build any application implementing Keyple.\nIt is essential for the future user of Keyple to be familiar with what is said in this chapter because the other modules made available by the project are all dependent on Keyple Core.","tags":null,"title":"Common concepts","type":"book"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Overview A centralized application is an application that runs in a device in contact with the end user.\nIt has at least one local smart card reader and manages itself the interaction with the user.\nIn the ticketing industry, it is typically the software that runs a validator, a vending machine or a control terminal.\nThe diagram below illustrates the organization of the local centralized components:   Before you start  In pre-requisite, read the common concepts page and become familiar with the basic concepts on which Keyple is based. Any implementation of a Keyple application starts with the implementation of Keyple Core, please study the workflow proposed in the following chapter. Explore the Keyple Core API to discover all the possibilities offered by Keyple Core. Take inspiration from the examples. Follow the explanations given in the Build your first app section to configure your environment. Using the Java components or C++ components pages, import Keyple Core into your project and start playing with Keyple. Don\u0026rsquo;t forget to explore the potential of Keyple card-specific extensions such as Keyple Calypso.  Workflow Keyple Core is built around the concepts described here and sometimes proposes several ways to perform an action or to achieve a result depending on the needs of the application.\nThe purpose of this section is to guide you in its use.\nCreation of the Smart Card Service This is the very first step in the realization of a Keyple application:\n/* Get the instance of the SmartCardService */ SmartCardService smartCardService = SmartCardService.getInstance();  The Smart Card Service is based on the SmartCardService object, which is a singleton that must be held by the application all along its execution.\nIts main role is to centralize Keyple resources and manage their lifecycle.\nChoose the plugin The Keyple application developer will choose the plugins he needs according to the equipment on which his Keyple application will run.\nFor example, if the environment is PC based, one will probably, but without obligation, go for the PC/SC plugin.\nFor an Andoid terminal environment, the plugin could be the standard Android NFC plugin or one of the plugins available from the industrial partners of the project. For a complete list of available plugins, please see the Java or C++ pages.\n A new plugin can also be created if the envisaged hardware does not yet have its plugin.   Register the plugin All Keyple plugins implement the Plugin interface.\nThe plugin registration consists in submitting its factory to the Smart Card Service.\n/* Assign the PcscPlugin to the SmartCardService */ plugin = smartCardService.registerPlugin(new PcscPluginFactory(null, readerExceptionHandlerImpl));   The plugin factories all implement the interface expected by SmartCardService.\nDepending on the case, the constructor of the factory provided by the plugin can take parameters as argument.\nFor example, in the code above, the PC/SC plugin expects exception handlers, but in other cases it could be other parameters.\n  Observation of the plugin  The notion of plugin observation applies only to hardware environments in which the readers are removable.   The observation of reader connections and disconnections is achieved through a background task managed by Keyple Core.\nIt is therefore imperative to provide an exception handler to allow Keyple Core to warn the application in case of an execution error during monitoring or event notification.\nHere is an example of exception handler implementation in a PC/SC plugin context:\n... private static class PluginExceptionHandlerImpl implements PluginObservationExceptionHandler { @Override public void onPluginObservationError(String pluginName, Throwable throwable) { logger.error(\u0026quot;An unexpected plugin error occurred: {}\u0026quot;, pluginName, throwable); } } } /* Create an exception handler for plugin observation */ PluginExceptionHandlerImpl pluginExceptionHandlerImpl = new ExceptionHandlerImpl(); /* Assign the PcscPlugin to the SmartCardService */ plugin = smartCardService.registerPlugin(new PcscPluginFactory(pluginExceptionHandlerImpl, null)); ...  For the observation of the plugin itself, the application must provide an object implementing the PluginObserver interface to the plugin after having casted it in ObservablePlugin.\n((ObservablePlugin) plugin).addObserver(new PluginObserver());  The PluginObserver interface requires the implementation of the update method that will be called by Keyple Core when notifying plugin events.\nclass PluginObserver implements ObservablePlugin.PluginObserver { @Override public void update(PluginEvent event) { switch (event.getEventType()) { case READER_CONNECTED: // here the processing to be done when a reader is connected ... break; case READER_DISCONNECTED: // here the processing to be done when a reader is disconnected ... break; default: break; } } } }  Retrieve the reader Readers are objects implementing the Reader interface and are returned by the plugin\u0026rsquo;s getReader method taking the name of the reader as argument.\nThe names of the readers available from the plugin are returned as a list of strings by the getReaderNames method.\nThe getReaders method also allows to retrieve all readers in a Map whose key is the name of the reader and the value the Reader object.\nHere is an example to get the 1st PC/SC reader:\nString readerName = plugin.getReaderNames().get(0); Reader reader = plugin.getReader(readerName);   Depending on the type of plugin, the reader names are more or less dynamic (e.g. a PC/SC based system vs. an embedded terminal), it is sometimes necessary to implement an identification mechanism in order to assign the right reader to the right place in the system (for example by using regular expressions).   Customize the reader settings Take a close look at the parameters proposed by the plugin and its readers.\nIn particular, it is necessary to configure the expected communication protocols, but it is also possible that other settings exist depending on the hardware context.\nObservation of the reader The observation of inserting and removing cards from readers is similar to the observation of plugins in that it requires the same operations, i.e. the use of an exception handler and an object implementing a dedicated interface.\n... private static class ReaderExceptionHandlerImpl implements ReaderObservationExceptionHandler { @Override public void onReaderObservationError(String pluginName, String readerName, Throwable throwable) { logger.error(\u0026quot;An unexpected reader error occurred: {}:{}\u0026quot;, pluginName, readerName, throwable); } } } /* Create an exception handler for reader observation */ ReaderExceptionHandlerImpl readerExceptionHandlerImpl = new ExceptionHandlerImpl(); /* Assign the PcscPlugin to the SmartCardService */ plugin = smartCardService.registerPlugin(new PcscPluginFactory(pluginExceptionHandlerImpl, readerExceptionHandlerImpl)); ...  The observation of the events of the reader is done in a similar way to that of the plugin, by adding an observer:\n((ObservableReader) reader).addObserver(new ReaderObserver());  and implementing the ReaderObserver interface:\nclass ReaderObserver implements ObservableReader.ReaderObserver { @Override public void update(ReaderEvent event) { switch (event.getEventType()) { case CARD_INSERTED: // here the processing to be done when a card is inserted ... break; case CARD_MATCHED: // here the processing to be done when a card matched the selection ... break; case CARD_REMOVED: // here the processing to be done when a card is removed ... break; default: break; } } } }   Observation of the readers is optional in Keyple. It facilitates an event-driven programming mode, but an application developer can choose not to observe a reader, either because this reader is not designed to manage card insertions/withdrawals (for example an Android OMAPI reader or a SAM reader), or because the application is designed to directly manage the presence of a card (refer to the Reader interface).   Card selection The card selection service offered by Keyple Core gives multiple possibilities to choose the processing according to the type of card presented to the reader.\nIt is based on a filtering process according to three possible criteria, each of which is optional:\n the communication protocol of the card (usually also identifying a card technology) the answer to reset of the card (ATR) the ISO standardized application identifier (AID)  Each of these criteria can be defined in a CardSelector object.\nWhen a card is inserted, it is evaluated according to these criteria and will be given the status \u0026ldquo;selected\u0026rdquo; or not.\nWhen a card is not selected, no other operation will be possible with it. Depending on the chosen setting, the result of the selection will or will not be made available to the application. It is thus possible to directly ignore cards that do not correspond to the defined selection criteria.\nWhen a card is selected, the result is an object that extends the AbstractSmartCard and contains all the information known about the card at that stage.\nIn the case of a ISO standardized card, the application is selected with the provided AID (additional settings are available to specify the desired navigation within the card applications list).\nIn addition to the selection process itself, specific APDU commands can be sent to the card if the selection is successful. The output data of these commands are available in the instance of the object AbstractSmarCard.\nThe CardSelector and the additional APDU commands are grouped in a CardSelectionRequest object.\nOne or more CardSelectionRequest can be set up to perform as many selection cases, each targeting a particular card or application.\nThe final selection process takes as input a list of CardSelectionRequest and gets in return a list of CardSelectionResponse.\nCard selection steps In this guide we will not show the addition of supplementary APDU commands. Please refer to the Calypso guide for an implementation example.\nCreate the card selection service The card selection service will be used all along the card search process.\ncardSelectionService = new CardSelectionsService();  Create the selection cases The application can create as many selection cases as the type of cards expected. The order in which the selection cases are prepared is important because it will favor the latency delay for the processing of the cards corresponding to the first case. It is therefore recommended to place the most common card profile in the application context first.\n/** Create a new class extending AbstractCardSelection */ public final class GenericCardSelection extends AbstractCardSelection { public GenericCardSelection(CardSelector cardSelector) { super(cardSelector); } @Override protected AbstractSmartCard parse(CardSelectionResponse cardSelectionResponse) { class GenericSmartCard extends AbstractSmartCard { public GenericSmartCard(CardSelectionResponse cardSelectionResponse) { super(cardSelectionResponse); } public String toJson() { return \u0026quot;{}\u0026quot;; } } return new GenericSmartCard(cardSelectionResponse); } } final String aid1 = \u0026quot;AABBCCDDEE\u0026quot;; final String aid2 = \u0026quot;EEDDCCBBAA\u0026quot;; // first selection case targeting cards with AID1 GenericCardSelection cardSelector1 = new GenericCardSelection( CardSelector.builder() .cardProtocol(ContactlessCardCommonProtocols.ISO_14443_4.name()) .aidSelector(CardSelector.AidSelector.builder().aidToSelect(aid1).build()) .build()); // Add the selection case to the current selection cardSelectionsService.prepareSelection(cardSelector1); // first selection case targeting cards with AID1 GenericCardSelection cardSelector2 = new GenericCardSelection( CardSelector.builder() .cardProtocol(ContactlessCardCommonProtocols.ISO_14443_4.name()) .aidSelector(CardSelector.AidSelector.builder().aidToSelect(aid2).build()) .build()); // Add the selection case to the current selection cardSelectionsService.prepareSelection(cardSelector2);  Proceed to the selection with a non-observable reader The processExplicitSelections method of CardSelectionService performs the actual communication with the card.\n... // Check if a card is present in the reader if (!reader.isCardPresent()) { logger.error(\u0026quot;No Po Card is present in the reader.\u0026quot;); return; } // Actual card communication: operate through a single request the card selection CardSelectionsResult cardSelectionsResult = cardSelectionsService.processExplicitSelections(reader); ...  Proceed to the selection with an observable reader In the case of an observable reader, the selection request is provided to the reader (it is then named Default Selection) and will be processed automatically as soon as a card is presented. The application is then notified of the event with the data resulting from the selection. Depending on the selection settings, the application will be notified of all card presentations (CARD_INSERTED event) or only those presentations that led to a successful selection (CARD_MATCHED event).\nAdd a default selection // Provide the Reader with the selection operation to be processed when a card is inserted. ((ObservableReader) reader) .setDefaultSelectionRequest( cardSelectionService.getDefaultSelection().getDefaultSelectionsRequest(), ObservableReader.NotificationMode.MATCHED_ONLY, ObservableReader.PollingMode.REPEATING);  The NotificationMode allows you to specify whether all card insertions should be reported to the application or only those that led to a successful selection.\nPollingMode indicates whether to go back to waiting for the card after processing (REPEATING) or let the application decide when to restart the search (SINGLESHOT) with startCardDetection.\nNote: when the default selection is set with the PollingMode parameter, the card detection is started automatically. However, it is possible to set a default selection without automatic start and by starting the detection independently with startCardDetection.\nReceive the result as an event ... @Override public void update(ReaderEvent event) { switch (event.getEventType()) { case CARD_MATCHED: AbstractSmartCard selectedCard = null; try { selectedCard = getDefaultSelection() .processDefaultSelectionsResponse(event.getDefaultSelectionsResponse()) .getActiveSmartCard(); } catch (KeypleException e) { logger.error(\u0026quot;Exception: {}\u0026quot;, e.getMessage()); ((ObservableReader) (event.getReader())).finalizeCardProcessing(); } if (selectedCard != null) { logger.info(\u0026quot;Observer notification: the selection of the card has succeeded.\u0026quot;); // insert the processing of the card here ... logger.info(\u0026quot;= #### End of the card processing.\u0026quot;); } else { logger.error( \u0026quot;The selection of the card has failed.

((ObservableReader) (event.getReader())).finalizeCardProcessing(); } } ...  Get the selection result The result of the selection is available in the AbstractSmartCard object.\n... if (!cardSelectionsResult.hasActiveSelection()) { logger.warn(\u0026quot;The selection of the application \u0026quot; + cardAid + \u0026quot; failed.\u0026quot;); } AbstractSmartCard smartCard = cardSelectionsResult.getActiveSmartCard(); logger.info(\u0026quot;The selection of the card has succeeded.\u0026quot;); if (smartCard.hasFci()) { String fci = ByteArrayUtil.toHex(smartCard.getFciBytes()); logger.info(\u0026quot;Application FCI = {}\u0026quot;, fci); } if (smartCard.hasAtr()) { String atr = ByteArrayUtil.toHex(smartCard.getAtrBytes()); logger.info(\u0026quot;Card ATR = {}\u0026quot;, atr); } ...  Implementation of the application service The applicative processing of the card that follows the selection of the card is to be inserted in the processing of the CARD_INSERTED or CARD_MATCHED event.\nIt can be processed in the thread provided by the monitoring task or detached in a separate thread. The application developer must pay attention to the handling of exceptions in this part of the application. Indeed, in case of a runtime exception, the information will be given to the application via the exception handler configured beforehand.\nStopping the application The clean shutdown of a Keyple application requires the release of resources and in particular the shutdown of the observation threads.\nThis is done by unregistering the plugins in the following way:\nsmartCardService.unregisterPlugin(plugin.getName());  Keyple Core API To learn all the details of the Keyple Core API, please consult the Javadoc documentation.\nHowever, here are two diagrams showing the main features of Keyple Core:\n  The diagram below represents the main classes implemented around the Smart Card Service with in particular the observation mechanisms.

In pre-requisite, read page Develop a Centralized Application to understand the main concepts of Keyple in a centralized application. Read chapter Concepts to understand the main terms and concepts of the Keyple Distributed solution. Read the introduction of chapter Remote Plugins to be informed about the different remote plugins and APIs proposed by the solution. Using chapter Use cases, find your use case. This will help you to determine exactly which library and API to use. Using chapter Download, import into your project the libraries specified by your use case. Using chapter Network configuration, implement the transport layer adapted to your network configuration. Implement your ticketing services as specified in the associated use case.  Concepts Here are the main concepts to keep in mind before continuing to read this developer guide :\n   Concept Description     Remote Lib This is the library keyple-plugin-remote-remote.\nIt must be imported and used by the application installed on the terminal not having local access to the smart card reader and that wishes to control the reader remotely.   Local Lib This is the library keyple-plugin-remote-local.\nIt must be imported and used by the application installed on the terminal having local access to the smart card reader but wishes to delegate all or part of the ticketing processing to a remote application.   Network Lib This is the library keyple-plugin-remote-network.\nThis library is implicitly imported by Remote Lib and Local Lib because it contains common network elements.   Remote Plugin Part of the Remote Lib, this is a Keyple plugin which provides only Remote Readers to the application. It manages data exchanges with the Local Service. This plugin must be registered to the smart card service like any Keyple plugin.   Remote Reader Part of the Remote Plugin, this is a Keyple reader which has some specificities :\n- each remote reader is connected to a local reader ;\n- any command sent by the application to a remote reader will be forwarded to the associated local reader ;\n- any event occurs on a local reader or plugin will be forwarded to the associated remote reader or plugin.   Local Service Part of the Local Lib, this service ensures data exchange between the Remote Plugin and local plugins and readers. It must be initialized and started by the host application.   Factory Remote Plugin and Local Service each have a specific factory class to initialize them.   Utility Remote Plugin and Local Service each have a specific utility class to access them everywhere in the code.   Node Remote Plugin and Local Service each are bind to a specific internal node which is responsible for the interfacing with the Network Endpoint.   Network Endpoint At the user\u0026rsquo;s charge, this component ensures the network exchanges between the Remote Plugin and Local Service nodes.      #concepts-table-1 table th:first-of-type { width: 130px; }  The diagram below illustrates the main functional concepts through a standard use case :\n  The second diagram below illustrates an arbitrary more complex possible use case with several hardware readers connected to different terminals.\nThese could be for example a ticketing reloading service, where the intelligence would be on the terminal with remote readers, with thin clients on A \u0026amp; B terminals communicating locally with the cards.\nIn this use case, the Keyple Distributed solution is use for card communication.\n  Here is another example, but this time it illustrates several Remote Plugin components connected to the same Local Service.\nThese could be for example ticketing terminals with transaction logic, which communicate locally with cards, but which do not have SAM, and which use a SAM server with hardware reader.\nIn this use case, the Keyple Distributed solution is use for SAM communication.\n  Remote Plugins The Keyple Distributed solution provides 3 different specific Remote Plugin components, each one having a specific API described in chapter Remote Plugins APIs designed on a Client-Server model in which the Client is always the initiator of the communication :\n   Plugin Description      RemotePluginServer Allows a server application to control a smart card reader available on a client (e.g. PO reader).    RemotePluginClient or\nObservableRemotePluginClient Allows a client application to control a smart card reader available on a server (e.g. SAM reader).    PoolRemotePluginClient Allows a client application to control a pool of smart cards readers available on a server (e.g. HSM readers).      #plugins-table-1 table th:first-of-type { width: 220px; }  Moreover, some plugins have different modes in which they allow or not the observation of plugin or reader events (such as smart card insertion, reader connection, etc\u0026hellip;).\nEach Remote Plugin and Local Service has a default name, but it\u0026rsquo;s possible to specify a custom name during the initialization phase.\nIt is thus possible to have within an application as many instances of a specific Remote Plugin or Local Service as desired.\nRemotePluginServer This plugin allows a server application to control a smart card reader available on a client (e.g. PO reader).\n   API Client Server     Library Local Lib Remote Lib   Remote Plugin / Local Service LocalServiceClient RemotePluginServer   Factory LocalServiceClientFactory RemotePluginServerFactory   Utility LocalServiceClientUtils RemotePluginServerUtils    USE AND SEQUENCE OF OPERATIONS  Server side :  configure the factory by providing the network and plugin observer implementation. Please note that this plugin is observable only to trigger ticketing services on the server side, but does not allow observation on the local plugin (reader insertion, etc\u0026hellip;), register the Remote Plugin to the smart card service using the factory, await for events of type PluginEvent.READER_CONNECTED, when an event occurs, get the specified remote reader from the Remote Plugin, use information inside the remote reader to identify the ticketing service to execute, execute the specified ticketing service using the remote reader and all of its others information, terminate the remote ticketing service using the Remote Plugin API by transmitting if needed personal information to the client.   Client side :  configure the factory and start the Local Service by providing the network implementation, register at least a local plugin to the smart card service and get the local reader to connect to the server, execute the remote service using the Local Service API by indicating the ticketing service id to execute and transmitting to the server if needed personal information or smart card content previously read.    ILLUSTRATION The following sequence diagram shows the capabilities of the plugin through an arbitrary example that illustrates :\n the initialization phase of the local and remote components ; the registration of the local plugin and observable reader ; the selection phase of an observable reader carried out directly by the client ; the sending of the selection result and additional information to the server to remotely perform a specific ticketing service (materialization, validation, etc\u0026hellip;) ; the reception by the server of the transmitted data ; the execution of the remote ticketing service ; the server subscription to observable reader events ; the sending of information to the client at the end of processing.  Note that the network layer is deliberately hide in this diagram. Its implementation is described in the Network configuration chapter.\n  RemotePluginClient This plugin allows a client application to control a smart card reader available on a server (e.g. SAM reader).\n   API Client Server     Library Remote Lib Local Lib   Remote Plugin / Local Service RemotePluginClient LocalServiceServer   Factory RemotePluginClientFactory LocalServiceServerFactory   Utility RemotePluginClientUtils LocalServiceServerUtils    USE AND SEQUENCE OF OPERATIONS  Server side :  configure the factory and start the Local Service by providing the network implementation, register at least a local plugin to the smart card service.

When a developer wants to include Keyple features within his project, he has to initialize the SmartCardService by providing a plugin Factory available with in the plugin library. The plugin to use depends on the targeted device and running environment.\nFor example, for an android device with native NFC we\u0026rsquo;ll use KeypleAndroidNfcPlugin.\nimplementation 'org.eclipse.keyple:keyple-android-plugin-nfc:$keyple_version'  [kotlin] SmartCardService.getInstance().registerPlugin(AndroidNfcPluginFactory())  Keyple is already provided with various plug-ins ready to use. For example Android NFC or PC/SC reader plugins.\nBut users of the Keyple API may need to use it on new hardware not covered with existing plugins. In this case, a new one must be developed.\nThe purpose of this guide is to support developers in this process.\nExisting plugins    Name plateform Import     Keyple Android NFC Android OS with android.nfc implementation Maven central   Keyple Android OMAPI Android OS with android.se or Simalliance openmobileapi implementation Maven Central   Keyple Android Famoco Famoco\u0026rsquo;s Android device using lib-secommunication-1.7.0 for NFC Contact us   Keyple Android Coppernic Coppernic\u0026rsquo;s Android OS using ASK Contact us   Keyple Android Wizway Android OS with Wizway NFC Agent Contact us   Keyple Java PCSC Device running JVM with connected PC/SC reader Maven Central    Class diagram of plugin package For the record, this is a wide view of classes implied in the plugin system. It is designed to natively handle as much use cas as possible while being easy to use. It results of several internal classes, however, plugin\u0026rsquo;s developers will only have to use a few part of these elements.\n  Steps Plugin\u0026rsquo;s development relies on 3 main steps, each one consists in implementing a few set of abstract classes and interfaces of plugin package from Keyple Core API:\n Import Keyple dependency Implement a Keyple Reader Implement a Keyple Plugin Implement a Keyple Plugin Factory.  Imports Your plugin will use be based upon Keyple Core libraries:\nimplementation \u0026quot;org.eclipse.keyple:keyple-java-core:$keyple_version\u0026quot;  Implement Keyple Reader The first step of a Keyple plugin development is the implementation of Keyple Reader Interface (org.eclipse.keyple.core.Reader). This implementation should use device\u0026rsquo;s native smartcard reader library (or sdk package) to map interfaces used by Keyple API.\nThis implementation of a local reader must be done through the extension of one of three abstract classes provided within the Keyple API. The choice depends on expected behaviour of the reader:\n AbstractLocalReader: Basic abstract class to use for local reader implementation. AbstractObservableLocalReader: extends AbstractLocalReader and is used to manage the matter of observing card events in the case of a local reader (ie: card insertion, card removal..). AbstractObservableLocalAutonomousReader: extends AbstractObservableLocalReader and is used to allow the reader implementation to call back the core when card insertion and removal events occurs.    Once chosen, the Abstract class must be extended by the new reader class and abstract methods must be implemented. Please refer to your native reader documentation to implement this elements.\nImplementation of AbstractLocalReader\u0026rsquo;s abstract classes Relying on the native smartcard reader of the device, implementations to be done are:\n   Method to implement Description     boolean checkCardPresence() Verify the presence of the card   byte[] getATR() provides the information retrieved when powering up the card   openPhysicalChannel() Attempts to open the physical channel   closePhysicalChannel() Attempts to close the current physical channel   boolean isPhysicalChannelOpen() Tells if the physical channel is open or not   boolean isCurrentProtocol(String readerProtocolName) Tells if the current card communicates with the protocol provided as an argument   byte[] transmitApdu(byte[] apduIn) Transmits a single APDU and receives its response. Both are in the form of an array of bytes.   activateReaderProtocol(String readerProtocolName) Activates the protocol provided from the reader\u0026rsquo;s implementation point of view.   deactivateReaderProtocol(String readerProtocolName) Deactivates the protocol provided from the reader\u0026rsquo;s implementation point of view.   isContactless() Tells if the current card communication is contactless.      #plugins-table-1 table th:first-of-type { width: 450px; }  Example of implementations are provided here.\nImplementation of AbstractObservableLocalReader\u0026rsquo;s abstract classes In addition of AbstractLocalReader\u0026rsquo;s methods, specific implementations to be done are:\nMethods    Method to implement Description     void onStartDetection() Invoked when the card detection is started by the Keyple Plugin   void onStopDetection() Invoked when the card detection is stopped by the Keyple Plugin   ReaderObservationExceptionHandler getObservationExceptionHandler() Allows to invoke the defined handler when an exception condition needs to be transmitted to the application level    Beside the implementation of this methods, this observable reader\u0026rsquo;s notification behaviour must be set.\nObservable reader\u0026rsquo;s notification Observable reader\u0026rsquo;s notification behaviour is set up by implementing interfaces inheriting from ObservableReaderNotifiers. Developer has to choose how the reader should behave regarding its native abilities. It may involve a few more methods to implement.\n  It is mandatory to implement one, and only one, interface of each use case presented in the related columns in the below table.\n   Card Insertion Card Removal Card Processing     WaitForCardInsertionAutonomous WaitForCardRemovalAutonomous WaitForCardRemovalDuringProcessing   WaitForCardInsertionBlocking WaitForCardRemovalBlocking DontWaitForCardRemovalDuringProcessing   WaitForCardInsertionNonBlocking WaitForCardRemovalNonBlocking \u0026mdash;    Description of the Insertion/Removal behaviours:\n   Type Description     [*]Autonomous Interface to be implemented by readers that have a fully integrated management of card communications for card insertion/removal detection   [*]Blocking Interface to be implemented by readers that are autonomous in the management of waiting for the insertion/removal of a card and that provide a method to wait for it indefinitely.   [*]Non Blocking Interface to be implemented by readers that require an active process to detect the card insertion /removal.      #plugins-table-2 table th:first-of-type { width: 180px; }  Description of the processing behaviours:\n   Type Description     WaitForCardRemovalDuringProcessing Interface to be implemented by readers able to detect a card removal during processing, between two APDU commands.   DontWaitForCardRemovalDuringProcessing Interface to be implemented by readers not able to detect a card removal during processing, between two APDU commands.      #plugins-table-3 table th:first-of-type { width: 350px; }  Example of implementations are provided here.\nImplementation of AbstractObservableLocalAutonomousReader\u0026rsquo;s abstract classes In addition of AbstractObservableLocalReader\u0026rsquo;s methods and ObservableReaderNotifiers implementation, specific methods invocation must be done:\n   Method to invoke Description     void onCardInserted() This method must be invoked when a card is inserted to.   void onCardRemoved() This method must be invoked when a card is removed.    Example of implementations are provided here.\nImplement Keyple Plugin The next step of Keyple plugin development is the implementation of Keyple Plugin Interface (org.eclipse.keyple.core.service.Plugin). The plugin will provide access to the readers and handle their lifecycle.\nAs well as Reader\u0026rsquo;s implementation, abstract classes to extend and interfaces to implement will depend on native abilities of the device.\nThis implementation of a plugin must be done through the extension of one of three abstract classes provided within the Keyple API. The choice depends on expected behaviour of the plugin:\n AbstractPlugin: Basic class for plugin implementation. AbstractObservablePlugin: This class provides the means to observe a plugin(insertion/removal of readers). AbstractThreadedObservablePlugin: This class provides the means to observe a plugin(insertion/removal of readers) using a monitoring thread.    Implementation of AbstractPlugin\u0026rsquo;s abstract classes initNativeReaders()    Method to implement Description     ConcurrentMap\u0026lt;String, Reader\u0026gt; initNativeReaders() This method is invoked when registering a plugin. It should be implemented to init readers map.    Example of implementations are provided here.\nImplementation of AbstractObservablePlugin\u0026rsquo;s abstract classes There is no additional methods to implement compared to AbstractPlugin\nImplementation of AbstractThreadedObservablePlugin\u0026rsquo;s abstract classes In addition of AbstractObservablePlugin\u0026rsquo;s methods and ObservableReaderNotifiers implementation, specific methods invocations must be done:\n   Method to implement Description     SortedSet\u0026lt;String\u0026gt; fetchNativeReadersNames() This method Fetch the list of connected native reader (usually from third party library) and returns their names (or id)   Reader fetchNativeReader(String name) Fetch connected native reader (from third party library) by its name returns the current AbstractReader if it is already listed. Creates and returns a new AbstractReader if not.      #plugins-table-4 table th:first-of-type { width: 300px; }  Example of implementations are provided here.\nImplementation of AbstractPluginFactory\u0026rsquo;s abstract classes The last step is to implement the Plugin factory which is going to be use by Keyple core to handle the plugin.\n   Method to implement Description     String getPluginName() Retrieve the name of the plugin that will be instantiated by this factory (can be static or dynamic)   Plugin getPlugin() Retrieve an instance of a plugin (can be a singleton)      #plugins-table-5 table th:first-of-type { width: 220px; }  Example of implementations are provided here.\nExamples of implementation AbstractLocalReader checkCardPresence() Allow Keyple to check if the smartcard is present within the reader (inserted, in NFC field\u0026hellip;)\nOMAPI Example\n[kotlin] //nativeReader is an instance of android.se.omapi.Reader. It natively provides a method to check Card presence. override fun checkCardPresence(): Boolean { return nativeReader.isSecureElementPresent }  Android NFC Example\n[kotlin] //When a SE is presented in the NFC field, we can get a tagproxy object.

In the class SelectionsResult (see processDefaultSelection/processExplicitSelection):\n  getActiveSelection is replaced by getActiveMatchingSe which returns an AbstractMatchingSe object (the still existing hasActiveSelection method must be used before)\n  getMatchingSelection is replaced by getMatchingSe which returns an AbstractMatchingSe object (may be null if the index provided does not correspond to a successful selection case)\n  getMatchingSelections now returns a Map containing a list of associated AbstractMatchingSe with the selection index that produced it (Map\u0026lt;Integer, AbstractMatchingSe\u0026gt;)\n  a new hasSelectionMatched method indicates whether the selection index provided corresponds to a successful selection case\n  a new getActiveSelectionIndex method returns the index of the active selection (the still existing hasActiveSelection method must be used before)\n  Definition of the security settings of the transaction These parameters are defined via the PoSecuritySettings class, whose construction now follows the Fluent Builder pattern.\nAll parameters are optional except the SamResource.\nHere is an example of a complete PoSecuritySettings build:\npoSecuritySettings = new PoSecuritySettings.PoSecuritySettingsBuilder(samResource) .sessionDefaultKif(AccessLevel.SESSION_LVL_PERSO, DEFAULT_KIF_PERSO) .sessionDefaultKif(AccessLevel.SESSION_LVL_LOAD, DEFAULT_KIF_LOAD) .sessionDefaultKif(AccessLevel.SESSION_LVL_DEBIT, DEFAULT_KIF_DEBIT) .sessionDefaultKeyRecordNumber(AccessLevel.SESSION_LVL_PERSO, DEFAULT_KEY_RECORD_NUMBER_PERSO) .sessionDefaultKeyRecordNumber(AccessLevel.SESSION_LVL_LOAD, DEFAULT_KEY_RECORD_NUMBER_LOAD) .sessionDefaultKeyRecordNumber(AccessLevel.SESSION_LVL_DEBIT, DEFAULT_KEY_RECORD_NUMBER_DEBIT) .sessionModificationMode(ModificationMode.ATOMIC) .ratificationMode(RatificationMode.CLOSE_RATIFIED) .sessionAuthorizedKvcList(authKvcs) .build();  Creation of the PoTransaction object Since PoSecuritySettings now integrates SamResource, the construction of PoTransaction has evolved slightly.\nHere is an example:\nPoTransaction poTransaction = new PoTransaction(new PoResource(poReader, calypsoPo), poSecuritySettings);  Transaction commands preparation Just as with the \u0026ldquo;prepare\u0026rdquo; commands used for selection, the \u0026ldquo;prepare\u0026rdquo; commands used for transactions no longer return indexes.\nThe available commands in version 0.9 are:\npublic final void prepareSelectFile(SelectFileControl control) public final void prepareSelectFile(short lid) public final void prepareSelectFile(byte[] lid) public final void prepareReadRecordFile(byte sfi, int recordNumber) public final void prepareReadRecordFile(byte sfi, int firstRecordNumber, int numberOfRecords, int recordSize)) public final void prepareReadCounterFile(byte sfi, int countersNumber) public final void prepareUpdateRecord(byte sfi, int recordNumber, byte[] recordData) public final void prepareWriteRecord(byte sfi, int recordNumber, byte[] recordData) public final void prepareAppendRecord(byte sfi, byte[] recordData) public final void prepareIncreaseCounter(byte sfi, int counterNumber, int incValue) public final void prepareDecreaseCounter(byte sfi, int counterNumber, int decValue)  Transaction commands processing The \u0026ldquo;process\u0026rdquo; commands have also been revised and simplified.\nThey all return void.\nIn case of failure a exception is raised (see below).\npublic final void processOpening(PoTransaction.SessionSetting.AccessLevel accessLevel)  The ModificationMode is no longer required since it is integrated in the PoSecuritySettings.\nParameters previously used to specify that a file is read at login are removed.\nInstead, the first prepareReadFile command will be automatically taken into account.\npublic final void processPoCommands() public final void processPoCommandsInSession() public final void processCancel(ChannelControl channelControl) public final void processClosing(ChannelControl channelControl)  Retrieving data read from POs This is a major evolution of the Keyple API. Previously, data read from Calyspo POs were retrieved by applications using \u0026ldquo;parser\u0026rdquo; methods.\nWith Keyple API 0.9, Calypso PO data is made available in the CalypsoPo object obtained during selection and enriched all along the operations performed with PoTransaction.\nThe public getter methods of CalypsoPo are:\npublic final String getDfName() public final byte[] getDfNameBytes() public final String getApplicationSerialNumber() public final byte[] getApplicationSerialNumberBytes() public final String getAtr() public final String getStartupInfo() public final PoRevision getRevision() public final byte getSessionModification() public final byte getApplicationType() public final byte getApplicationSubtype() public final byte getPlatform() public final byte getSoftwareIssuer() public final byte getSoftwareVersion() public final byte getSoftwareRevision() public final boolean isDeselectRatificationSupported() public final boolean isConfidentialSessionModeSupported() public final boolean isPublicAuthenticationSupported() public final boolean isPinFeatureAvailable() public final boolean isSvFeatureAvailable() public final boolean isDfInvalidated() public final boolean isDfRatified() public final DirectoryHeader getDirectoryHeader() public final ElementaryFile getFileBySfi(byte sfi) public final ElementaryFile getFileByLid(short lid) public final Map\u0026lt;Byte, ElementaryFile\u0026gt; getAllFiles()  Four new classes DirectoryHeader, ElementaryFile, FileHeader and FileData have been added.\nDirectoryHeader The public getters for this class are:\npublic short getLid() public byte[] getAccessConditions() public byte[] getKeyIndexes() public byte getDfStatus() public byte getKif(AccessLevel level) public byte getKvc(AccessLevel level) public String toString()  ElementaryFile The public getters for this class are:\npublic byte getSfi() public FileHeader getHeader() public FileData getData() public String toString()  FileHeader The public getters for this class are:\npublic short getLid() public int getRecordsNumber() public int getRecordSize() public FileType getType() public byte getDfStatus() public boolean isShared() public Short getSharedReference() public byte[] getAccessConditions() public byte[] getKeyIndexes() public String toString()  FileData The public getters for this class are:\npublic byte[] getContent() public byte[] getContent(int numRecord) public byte[] getContent(int numRecord, int dataOffset, int dataLength) public SortedMap\u0026lt;Integer, byte[]\u0026gt; getAllRecordsContent() public int getContentAsCounterValue(int numCounter) public SortedMap\u0026lt;Integer, Integer\u0026gt; getAllCountersValue() public String toString()  So, for example to extract the contents of contract files present in the PO, the code might look like this:\n[...] /* Read all 4 contracts command, record size set to 29 */ poTransaction.prepareReadRecordFile(CalypsoClassicInfo.SFI_Contracts, CalypsoClassicInfo.RECORD_NUMBER_1, 4, 29); /* proceed with the sending of commands, don't close the channel */ poTransaction.processPoCommandsInSession(); ElementaryFile efContracts = calypsoPo.getFileBySfi(CalypsoClassicInfo.SFI_Contracts); SortedMap\u0026lt;Integer, byte[]\u0026gt; records = efContracts.getData().getAllRecordsContent(); for (Map.Entry\u0026lt;Integer, byte[]\u0026gt; entry : records.entrySet()) { logger.info(\u0026quot;Contract #{}: {}\u0026quot;, entry.getKey(), ByteArrayUtil.toHex(entry.getValue())); } [...]  Error handling Since version 0.9, all Keyple exceptions are of the RuntimeException type.\nCatching exceptions is therefore now optional.\nHowever, it is possible to selectively catch certain exceptions in order to deal with particular cases.\nThe new hierarchy of Keyple exceptions is shown here\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1603811078,"objectID":"0c708f778edc51e07d87f819c4c14ced","permalink":"/keyple-website/docs/developer-guide/migration-0.8.1-to-0.9.0/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/keyple-website/docs/developer-guide/migration-0.8.1-to-0.9.0/","section":"docs","summary":"This guide is intended to help a user of version 0.8.1 of Keyple Java to upgrade his application to the 0.9.0 version of the library.\nFrom a user API point of view, the changes relate to the following topics:","tags":null,"title":"Migration Guide - Keyple Java 0.8.1 to 0.9.0","type":"book"},{"authors":["Calypso Networks Association"],"categories":["Events"],"content":"Are you a mobility aggregator, a system integrator, an event manager, a developer or a multi-mobility startup?
