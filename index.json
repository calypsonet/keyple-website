However, in order for the concept of Mobility as a Service to become a reality, and at a reasonable cost, the ecosystem should, as far as possible, rely on open standards, APIs and SDKs as well as Open Source technologies. This openness has already been a reality for several years in the field of passenger information and has enabled the explosion of rich and high-quality applications, thanks in particular to Open Data. Today, Eclipse Keyple™ is paving the way for ticketing to follow the same path, by making available for free the first fully Open Source API.\nEclipse Keyple™ accelerates the integration and development of ticketing applications by enabling multimodal transport services, public transport operators and event organizers to implement ticketing and access control systems based on a common, open and modular base.\nEclipse Keyple™ works with Keyple\u0026rsquo;s extensions. The first available extension allows you to benefit from Calypso®'s main features of reliability, security and interoperability.\nEclipse Keyple™ transforms complex contactless ticketing, transportation and event access systems into a simple integration to manage terminal readers and portals that use smart cards and mobile applications to enter and exit.\nAs an open source technology, Eclipse Keyple™ offers uniformity of structure but does not lock you into a specific ticketing system.

For example, a smart card reader could be a terminal, a portable scanning laser gun, or a swipe tablet area that is embedded into a door, vehicle or gate. Code is written for a terminal to set the parameters for allowing cards or apps to transmit ticketing information data. Sometimes in a distributed architecture system design, the code for the reader is not on the terminal, but in a cloud environment, so the reader sends the data to cloud-based architecture. Ticketing application: This is behind-the-scenes code that is able to take the data from the smart card reader and, in milliseconds real-time, analyze the balance of the ticket, confirm the permissions for entry, and update the data on the ticket (for example, to confirm that the ticket holder can enter the gate or vehicle, and then to deduct the cost of the journey and calculate the new balance).  According to this scheme, Keyple™ defines two layers:\n Smart Card readers are integrated through plugins implementing the SE Proxy API which manages the communications with a smart card through any type of contactless or contact reader (local, remote, standard, proprietary…) Ticketing applications relies on a high-level Calypso® processing API to manage Calypso® commands \u0026amp; security features. This API uses the SE Proxy API to communicate with the reader  Keyple™ comes with dedicated plugins that integrate directly with smart card readers that have been built on standard software interfaces including PC/SC, Android NFC reader, and Android OMAPI.\nIn cases where there is a distributed architecture design, Keyple™ includes a Remote API plugin so that a smart card terminal can be operated remotely, as if it were local to the terminal, and ensures that robust security and speed is not sacrificed in a cloud-based system.\nThe Calypso Processing API is also available as a Keyple™ extension. This component carries out the terminal processing element of ticketing technology. Access to Calypso’s security features are automatically managed by the Keyple™ extension.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1607964312,"objectID":"bf786b8ea9088ea228a979a08534bfca","permalink":"https://keyple.org/what-is-keyple/main-features/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/what-is-keyple/main-features/","section":"what-is-keyple","summary":"Keyple makes contactless ticketing accessible.","tags":null,"title":"Keyple's main features","type":"what-is-keyple"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Overview The Eclipse Keyple solution provides currently 2 modules:\n the \u0026lsquo;Keyple Core\u0026rsquo;, a universal smart card reader interface to manage the setting of smart card reader, the detection and the communication with smart card, and the selection of card application. the \u0026lsquo;Keyple Calypso\u0026rsquo;, a first smart card solution extension built on the Keyple Core, dedicated to manage Calypso processing, Calypso card identification, card command generation, card data recovery, authentication with the secure session.

The Keyple Calypso extension provides the Calypso API: a high-level interface to manage Calypso card processing.\nApplication integration The Card API is a low-level interface to manage the transmission of APDU commands with a smart card. A terminal application operating processing with a specific smart card solution could be implemented directly on top the Card API.\n  Keyple Architecture Application Integration   Another way offering a better abstraction on smart card technical settings could be to implement on the Card API a smart card solution library extension providing a high level interface: a specific Solution API. This is how the Keyple Calypso extension has be defined, the Calypso API is a high level functional interface, which hides the low-level APDU operations.\nReader integration native integration The smart card readers could be directly integrated with the Keyple Core. By interfacing through the Plugin API, a specific plugin dedicated to a smart card reader solution, the Keyple Core could have the capability to fully manage the smart card readers corresponding to this native plugin.\n  Keyple Architecture Reader Integration Native   The Eclipse Keyple project provides the plugin for the main standard smart card reader solutions.\n  Keyple Architecture Native Plugins    The PC/SC plugin is available for both the Java and the C++ implementation of Eclipse Keyple, it allows to interface PC/SC reader on Windows, Linux and Mac OS. For Android devices the NFC plugin allows to operate the standard NFC interface to handle external contactless smart card. And the OMAPI plugin provides the integration of internal eSE (embedded Secure Element) or UICC (SIM card). Both plugins support Keyple Java. The Remote plugin (part of the Core distributed extension) allows to operate remote smart card readers.  hybrid integration It\u0026rsquo;s also possible to integrate Keyple in a terminal solution already embedding not Keyple based terminal applications operating smart card solutions. In those kinds of terminal, a Reader Manager has already the direct control on a smart card reader and manage the smart card detection: depending on the type of smart card identified on the reader, a specific terminal application is requested to operated the processing of the smart card.\n  Keyple Architecture Hybrid Plugins   In this case a reader manager plugin, also based on the Plugin API, could allow the Keyple Core to operate the processing of a specific smart card, when requested by the Reader Manager.\nFor example, an EMV certified reader manager could call a Keyple application in case of PPSE selection failure.\nSmart card processing stand-alone By default, a terminal application manages the processing of a specific smart card in stand-alone with its local readers.\n  Keyple Architecture Local Plugin   distributed The \u0026lsquo;Distributed\u0026rsquo; extension of the Keyple Core provides a solution allowing a master terminal application to manage the processing of a smart card localized in a remote driven terminal.   Keyple Architecture Remote Plugin   Smart card transaction There are two ways for a terminal application to manage a transaction with a smart card.\n Either the smart card processing could be directly started by the terminal application.

The \u0026lsquo;SmartCard Service\u0026rsquo; singleton provides the unique name list of registered plugins. There can be three kinds of plugin:\n ‘Plugin’ is the generic interface to list the readers of a plugin, or to access to a specific reader with its name. The ‘Observable Plugin’ interface extends Plugins which have the capability to be observed: in order to notify registered Plugin Observers about the plug or unplug of readers. Plugin Observers could be added or removed to the Observable Plugin. Useful for systems allowing the hot plug / unplug of Readers. A ‘Pool Plugin’ is a plugin for which a Reader is available only after an explicit allocation. When not more necessary, a Reader must be released. Useful for server solutions managing farms of Readers or interfaced with HSM: unallocated Readers or HSM instances could be shared between several smartcard terminal solutions.  A smartcard Reader is identified through its unique name in a Plugin. There are two kinds of Reader:\n The ‘Reader’ is the generic interface to handle a smartcard reader. The presence of card in a Reader could be checked. The ‘Observable Reader’ interface extends Readers which have the capability to notify registered Reader Observers about the insertion or remove of a Card in the Reader. Reader Observers could be added or removed to the Observable Reader. Useful for systems automatically starting the processing of a Card at its insertion: like a ticketing validator.   [Reader Access v1.0.0     (The APDU transmission with a Card is managed at a lower layer, through a Card Solution API.)\nSpecific Plugin integration The Plugins are registered to the SmartCard Service through related specific Plugin Factory.   Specific Plugin v1.0.0   Reader Notifications To be notified about \u0026lsquo;Plugin Event\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;Reader Event\u0026rsquo;, a terminal application must implement the dedicated \u0026lsquo;Plugin Observer\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;Reader Observer\u0026rsquo; interfaces.\n  Reader Notifications v1.0.0   Plugin Event Several ‘Plugin Observers’ could be registered to an Observable Plugin. In case of reader connection / disconnection, the Observable Plugin notifies sequentially the registered Plugin Observers with the corresponding Plugin Event. The Observable Plugin is a blocking API, the thread managing the issuance of the Plugin Event waits the acknowledge of the Plugin Observer currently notified.\nReader Event Several ‘Reader Observers’ could be registered to an Observable Reader. In case of Card insertion / removal or selection match, the Observable Reader notifies sequentially the registered Reader Observers with the corresponding Reader Event. The Observable Reader could be a blocking API, the thread managing the issuance of the Plugin Event could wait the acknowledge of the notified Reader Observers.\nAn Observable Reader has the capability to be set with a ‘Default Selections Request’: in this case when a Card is inserted in the Reader, the Reader will try to operate the configured default selections. If a selection successfully matches with the Card, instead to simply notify about the insertion of a Card, the Observable Reader will notify about a successful selection with a Card application.\n If the notification mode is defined as ‘always’, then in case of Card insertion, the Observable Reader will notify a matched card Reader Event in case of successful selection, or a simple card insertion Reader Event if not. If the notification mode is defined as ‘matched only’, then in case of Card insertion, simple card insertion Reader Events are not notified.  When the processing of an inserted or matched Card is finished, a Reader Observer must release the logical channel with the Card, in order to prepare the Observable Reader to detect the removal of the Card.\nObservable Reader states An Observable Reader is active only when at least one Reader Observer is registered, and if the start of the detection has been requested. When active, an Observable Reader could switch between three internal states: ‘Wait for Card Insertion’, ‘Wait for Card Processing’, \u0026amp; ‘Wait for Card Removal’.\nIn the nominal case, a Reader Observer indicates to the Observable Reader that the processing of the SE is finished by releasing the Card Channel. To manage a failure of the Reader Observer process, the Observable Reader interface provides also a method to finalize the Card processing.\n  Observable Reader States   The states could be switched:\n due to an explicit API request (blue arrows):  the release of the Card Channel, the call of an Observable Reader method:  the addition or the remove of an Observable Reader, a request to start or stop the detection, to finalize the Card processing.     Or because of an external event (red arrows), the insertion or the remove of a Card.  the insertion a Card causing the Observable Reader to notify a \u0026lsquo;Card matched\u0026rsquo; Reader Event (in case of successful default selection) or a \u0026lsquo;Card inserted\u0026rsquo; Reader Event (Notification Mode defined as always). the removal of a Card causing the Observable Reader to notify a \u0026lsquo;Card removed\u0026rsquo; Reader Event.    If a Card detection is started with the \u0026lsquo;repeating\u0026rsquo; polling mode, then later when the Card is removed, the Reader starts again the detection of a new Card.\nWhatever the Plugin of Observable Reader, when waiting for the Card removal, any Observable Reader shall have the capability to notify the remove of the Card. Some Plugin solutions could have the capability to notify a Card removal also during the processing of the Card.\nCard Selection Selection scenarios Depending on the Card transaction use case, or on the Reader capability, there are two ways to manage the Selection of a Card:\n Either on a simple Reader, a Selection could be operated directly by transmitting the Selection Request. In this case the same entity manages both the Card Selection and the Card processing. Otherwise, on an Observable Reader, a Default Selection could be defined. In this case the Selection is operated automatically at the insertion of the Card. In this case, the Card Selection is next managed by the Observable Reader, but the Card processing is managed by a Reader Observer.    Selection v1.0.0   Selection setting and processing A Card Selection request is defined with a Card Selector. A Card Selector could be defined with tree optional levels of selection filter.\n The selection could be limited to match a specific card communication protocol. The Card ATR could be filtered to match a regular expression. If an AID is defined, the local reader transmits a Select Application APDU command to the card. If a SE Selector is defined without any filter, the selection is always successful if a card is present in the reader.  Depending on the Keyple Card Solution extension library, a card request could be completed with specific card commands to operate at the selection (for example, a Select File for a specific DF LID, the read of a specific file).\nFor terminal managing several kinds of card applications, a Card Selection could be prepared with several card selection request to operate sequentially with the card.\nAccording to the defined \u0026lsquo;multi selection processing\u0026rsquo; mode, the card selection could stop at the first selection request matching card application, otherwise all the prepared card selection request could be operated.\n Before the new processing of card selection request, the logical channel previously opened is closed. The \u0026lsquo;channel control\u0026rsquo; defines if the logical channel should be kept open or close after the last processed card selection request.    Card Selection v1.0.0   The result of a card request selection is a card image of a matching card. For a card selection with multiple requests, several matching card could be provided.\n\u0026lsquo;Card Interface\u0026rsquo; for the development of smartcard solution library\nThe Keyple Calypso extension uses the card interface to exchange APDU commands with Calypso cards and SAM.\nAPDU Transmission   APDU Transmission v1.0.0   \u0026lsquo;Plugin API\u0026rsquo; for the implementation of smartcard reader plugins\nPlugin Factorized Processing The implementation of Plugins requires to extend the classes AbstractPlugin and AbstractLocalReader.\n If the reader solution allows the hot plug/unplug of readers then AbstractThreadedObservablePlugin should be extended. In case the local reader has the capability to detect the insertion or the removal or a card, then AbstractObservableLocalReader should be extended.  For reader solutions managing themselves the allocation of logical channel for communicatio with smart cards, the interface SmartSelectionReader should be implemented (e.g. it is the case for the OMAPI plugin).\nOnly the abstract methods highlighted in blue have to be implemented have to be implemented by the specific plugins.\nFor plugins with ObservableReader: depending on the capability of the reader solution different interfaces could be implemented:\n WaitForCardInsertionAutonomous WaitForCardRemovalAutonomous WaitForCardRemovalDuringProcessing or DontWaitForCardRemovalDuringProcessing WaitForCardInsertionBlocking or WaitForCardInsertionNonBlocking WaitForCardRemovalBlocking or WaitForCardRemovalNonBlocking AbstractObservableLocalAutonomousReader    Plugin Factorized Processing v1.0.0   ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1608210561,"objectID":"ab9ddb1d301e4f8e2308e0076ac779a6","permalink":"https://keyple.org/docs/architecture/keyple-core/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/docs/architecture/keyple-core/","section":"docs","summary":"Features / packages and corresponding usages The Keyple Core is a tool to handle smart card reader and to operate generic processing with smart cards.\nThe Core is divided in 4 sub-modules:","tags":null,"title":"Keyple Core","type":"book"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Features / packages and corresponding usages The Calypso transaction API provides a high-level of abstraction to define functional commands to manage a secure session with a Calypso Portable Object, to update or authenticate its data.\nThe transaction API is defined on a low-level Calypso commands API which contains the builders of PO and SAM APDU commands, and the corresponding parsers of APDU responses.\n   Package APIlevel Feature     org.eclipse.keyple.calypso.transaction high Calypso Portable Object commands and secure transaction management CalypsoAPI, commands’ settings are limited to functional parameters Calypso SAM (Secure Module) operations automatically processed (only functional parameters)   org.eclipse.keyple.calypso.command org.eclipse.keyple.calypso.command.po org.eclipse.keyple.calypso.command.po.builder org.eclipse.keyple.calypso.command.po.parser org.eclipse.keyple.calypso.command.po.parser.session org.eclipse.keyple.calypso.command.sam org.eclipse.keyple.calypso.command.sam.builder org.eclipse.keyple.calypso.command.sam.parser org.eclipse.keyple.calypso.command.sam.parser.session low Calypso PO \u0026amp; SAM APDU commands' sets APDU command builders APDU response parsers (technical parameter settings specific to the PO \u0026amp; SAM revisions)\n    Ticketing terminal applications must import only the high-level Calypso transaction package.\n  Calypso packages   The only exception is the implementation a Calypso PO/SAM test tool, the setting of low-level APDU commands with wrong settings could require the usage of the Calypso command packages.\nCalypso Portable Object Selection Compared to the generic Card Selection API (cf. https://calypsonet.github.io/keyple/KeypleCoreApi/KeypleCore_ApplicationApi.html#card-selection), a PO Selector could be defined to accept only non-invalidated Portable Object (in this cas an invalidated PO isn\u0026rsquo;t selected).\nIn addition, a PO Selection Request provides methods:\n to prepare Select File command (useful in particular to manage REV1 Calypso PO for which the select of the targeted DF is required). and to prepare simple read record command (useful to optimize the read of a file present on all targeted PO).  The matching SmartCard resulting from a PO Selection Request is a Calypso PO. In case file records have been read during the selection: the corresponding data could be recovered in the Calypso PO card image.\n  Calypso Selection v1.0.0   Calypso Portable Object Transaction A Card Resource is a set of a Reader and a selected Card application.\n A Calypso Portable Object is the image of a selected Calypso PO. A Calypso SAM is the image of a selected Calypso SAM.  To operate a Calypso transaction:\n At least a Calypso Resource (CardResource) is required. A SAM Resource ((CardResource) is required too if security features are involved (Calypso secure session, Stored value transaction, PIN encryption, etc…).  A Calypso PO image provides public ‘getters’ in order to recover the information of the selected PO (startup data, file data, … etc).\nA transaction with a Calypso PO is fully managed through the PoTransaction object:\n First a set of PO commands could be defined through ‘prepare’ commands. Next the prepared PO commands transmitted when operating a ‘process’ command. The responses of the PO are then recovered through the Calypso PO image.

All project dependencies, including Keyple components, are downloaded during the first run, which can take some time.   FAQ How do I find out the names of the readers?\nTo find out the names of the readers connected to your computer, we will use Keyple with the following class which prints in the console the number and names of the readers present:\nimport org.eclipse.keyple.core.service.Plugin; import org.eclipse.keyple.core.service.SmartCardService; import org.eclipse.keyple.plugin.pcsc.PcscPluginFactory; import java.util.Set; public class ReaderDiscovery { public static void main(String[] args) { SmartCardService smartCardService = SmartCardService.getInstance(); Plugin plugin = smartCardService.registerPlugin(new PcscPluginFactory()); Set\u0026lt;String\u0026gt; names = plugin.getReaderNames(); System.out.println(names.size() + \u0026quot; readers found.\u0026quot;); for (String name : names) { System.out.println('\u0026quot;' + name + '\u0026quot;'); } } }  The console output should look something like:\n2 readers found. \u0026quot;ASK LoGO 0\u0026quot; \u0026quot;Identive CLOUD 2700 R Smart Card Reader 0\u0026quot;  Identify which reader will be the PO (contactless) reader and the SAM (contact) reader and replace PO_READER_NAME and SAM_READER_NAME with their values.\nHow to activate the Keyple\u0026rsquo;s logs?\nAs soon as the slf4j library is imported into the project, Keyple modules are able to produce logs.\nHowever, to take full advantage of the possibilities of this library, it is necessary to create a simplelogger.properties file in the /src/main/resources folder of the project.\nThe self-documented content of this file may be:\n# SLF4J's SimpleLogger configuration file # Simple implementation of Logger that sends all enabled log messages, for all defined loggers, to System.err. # Default logging detail level for all instances of SimpleLogger. # Must be one of (\u0026quot;trace\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;debug\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;info\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;warn\u0026quot;, or \u0026quot;error\u0026quot;). # If not specified, defaults to \u0026quot;info\u0026quot;. org.slf4j.simpleLogger.defaultLogLevel=debug # Logging detail level for a SimpleLogger instance named \u0026quot;xxxxx\u0026quot;. # Must be one of (\u0026quot;trace\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;debug\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;info\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;warn\u0026quot;, or \u0026quot;error\u0026quot;). # If not specified, the default logging detail level is used. #org.slf4j.simpleLogger.log.xxxxx= # Set to true if you want the current date and time to be included in output messages. # Default is false, and will output the number of milliseconds elapsed since startup. org.slf4j.simpleLogger.showDateTime=true # The date and time format to be used in the output messages. # The pattern describing the date and time format is the same that is used in java.text.SimpleDateFormat. # If the format is not specified or is invalid, the default format is used. # The default format is yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss:SSS Z. org.slf4j.simpleLogger.dateTimeFormat=[HH:mm:ss:SSS] # Set to true if you want to output the current thread name. # Defaults to true. org.slf4j.simpleLogger.showThreadName=true # Set to true if you want the Logger instance name to be included in output messages. # Defaults to true. org.slf4j.simpleLogger.showLogName=false # Set to true if you want the last component of the name to be included in output messages. # Defaults to false. org.slf4j.simpleLogger.showShortLogName=true org.slf4j.simpleLogger.levelInBrackets=true  Why do I see a warning in the console about illegal reflexive access when running the application?\nA known problem on Windows 8/10 platforms causes the smartcard service to stop when the last reader is removed. This problem prevents a \u0026ldquo;classic\u0026rdquo; monitoring of connections and disconnections of readers with the smartcard.io library (Java PC/SC). So for the moment we are using a workaround based on reflexivity to overcome this problem and allow a correct monitoring of the readers in the PC/SC plugin. This has the disadvantage of generating a warning message with recent versions of the JVM.

Keyple could also be used to develop an application reading SmartCard content through NFC using Android NFC.\n  As Keyple request low level reader access, the key features of Keyple SDK relies on components called \u0026lsquo;Plugins\u0026rsquo;.

Access to the readers is provided by the plugins.\nTo use Keyple core API (and in fact, anything keyple\u0026rsquo;s related) import the jar within the gradle dependencies of your Android application.\nimplementation \u0026quot;org.eclipse.keyple:keyple-java-core:$keyple_version\u0026quot;  Please refer to Architecture/Keyle Core\nKeyple Plugins There are many Keyple plugins available, the one to use depends on the device and ticketing tools you are aiming to use.\nTo use the NFC plugin simply import it within the gradle dependencies of your Android application.\nimplementation \u0026quot;org.eclipse.keyple:keyple-android-nfc:$keyple_version\u0026quot;  Keyple Calypso The Keyple Calypso User API is an extension of the Keyple Core User API to manage Calypso Portable Objects.\nPlease refer to Architecture/Keyle Calypso\nTo use Keyple Calypso User API simply import the jar within the gradle dependencies of your Android application.\nimplementation \u0026quot;org.eclipse.keyple:keyple-java-calypso:$keyple_version\u0026quot;  Let\u0026rsquo;s code Initializing the SDK Register a plugin In order to setup Keyple, we need to register at least one plugin. Here we register our NFC plugin. To do so, we use the singleton SmartCardService and the plugin Factory. (See plugin development guide to know more about plugins)\noverride fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) { super.onCreate(savedInstanceState) /* register Android NFC Plugin to the SmartCardService */ try { val readerObservationExceptionHandler = ReaderObservationExceptionHandler { pluginName, readerName, e -\u0026gt;} SmartCardService.getInstance().registerPlugin(AndroidNfcPluginFactory(this, readerObservationExceptionHandler)) }catch (e: KeypleException){ /* do something with it */ } }  Note: Plugins Factory\u0026rsquo;s initialisation could request more steps to execute before passing it to registerPlugin(). It depends on plugins, please check the documentation or usage example of desired plugin.\nUnregister a plugin Clean resources.\noverride fun onDestroy() { ... /* Unregister Android NFC Plugin to the SmartCardService */ SmartCardService.getInstance().unregisterPlugin(AndroidNfcPlugin.PLUGIN_NAME) reader = null super.onDestroy() }  Retrieve a specific reader With the plugin registered we can retrieve all instances of the component mapping the SmartCard readers. Here we want to retrieve the NFC reader.\n//We keep a reference to the reader for later use private lateinit var reader: AndroidNfcReader ... //PLUGIN_NAME and READER_NAME are constants provided by the used Keyple plugin reader = plugin.readers[AndroidNfcReader.READER_NAME] as AndroidNfcReader  Add observer to handle NFC events When native NFC is activated on an Android device, the OS dispatches insertion events occurring in the NFC detection field. In our application, we need detect it in order to proceed to exchanges with the SmartCard.\n//To keep it simple we choose to have our MainActivity implementing ObservableReader.ReaderObserver //interface. class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity(), ObservableReader.ReaderObserver { ... reader.addObserver(this) ... //Belongs to ObservableReader.ReaderObserver //NFC Reader events will be received here. //this method is not triggered in UI thread override fun update(event: ReaderEvent) { if(event.eventType == ReaderEvent.EventType.CARD_INSERTED){ //We'll select PO when SmartCard is presented in field //Method handlePo is described below handlePo() } } }  Activate a protocol Before starting to read a NFC tag, you must activate the protocol in which you wish to detect it.

The reader concept also applies to the hardware interfaces used to communicate with security elements such as SAMs (Secure Access Modules), which are sometimes integrated into devices and the virtual interfaces represented by the remote implementations.\n[link to the detailed description of the reader related classes]\nPlugin In Keyple language a plugin is a service that allows the management of readers of a certain type. The plugin is responsible for informing the application about the availability of readers. The readers of the same plugin are usually hardware linked to the same physical interface.\nDepending on its profile, an application may use different types of plugins to communicate with the different elements it needs (card, SAM).\nThe Plugin interface essentially allows to list and retrieve the available readers.\n[link to the detailed description of the plugin related classes]\nSmart card service This is the Keyple Core service that concentrates the knowledge of active plugins and readers.\nAt startup, a Keyple application must register the plugins it uses. Conversely, it can also unregister them.\nThe SmartCardService will then make sure that the resources used are properly released.\n[link to the detailed description of the reader related classes]\nObservation The observation concept applies to readers as well as to plugins; optional, it is used depending on the needs.\nIt consists in monitoring changes such as reader connection/disconnection or card insertion/removal and informing the observing application through a dedicated interface.\nNot all plugins and readers are observable.\nSelection In Keyple the concept of selection is derived from the application selection defined by the ISO7816-4 standard.\nIt supplements it by managing cards that do not have the standard command using identification mechanisms based on Answer To Reset and the communication protocol, and also by allowing the execution of commands immediately following application selection or detection.\nThis principle optimizes the processing by allowing the application to elaborate advanced card discovery requests.\nSeveral targets can be defined by the application according to the different customer cards expected.\nThe default selection principle consists in providing an observable reader with a set of selection cases corresponding to the expected cards and receiving notifications containing not only the card identification but also the result of all additional commands that the application will have attached.\nAbstract smart card The abstract smart card concept is used by specific extensions (e.g. Keyple Calypso) and by the Keyple Core selection mechanism. It corresponds to an abstract container model implemented by the extension specific to a card type and returned by the selection process.\nThis container will be able to carry all the useful information known about the card.\nNote: this concept, mentioned here for understanding, should not appear to the application developer if he uses a card extension.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1607714088,"objectID":"75da7a7b55da55c41fc1cb8fc8f8d35b","permalink":"https://keyple.org/docs/developer-guide/common-concepts/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/docs/developer-guide/common-concepts/","section":"docs","summary":"This page describes the core elements of Keyple, i.e. the concepts and APIs of Keyple Core that are used to build any application implementing Keyple.\nIt is essential for the future user of Keyple to be familiar with what is said in this chapter because the other modules made available by the project are all dependent on Keyple Core.","tags":null,"title":"Common concepts","type":"book"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Overview A standalone application is an application that runs in a device in contact with the end user.\nIt has at least one local smart card reader and manages itself the interaction with the user.\nIn the ticketing industry, it is typically the software that runs a validator, a vending machine or a control terminal.\nThe diagram below illustrates the organization of the local standalone components:   Before you start  In pre-requisite, read the common concepts page and become familiar with the basic concepts on which Keyple is based. Any implementation of a Keyple application starts with the implementation of Keyple Core, please study the workflow proposed in the following chapter. Explore the Keyple Core API to discover all the possibilities offered by Keyple Core. Take inspiration from the examples. Follow the explanations given in the Build your first app section to configure your environment. Using the Java components or C++ components pages, import Keyple Core into your project and start playing with Keyple. Don\u0026rsquo;t forget to explore the potential of Keyple card-specific extensions such as Keyple Calypso.  Workflow Keyple Core is built around the concepts described here and sometimes proposes several ways to perform an action or to achieve a result depending on the needs of the application.\nThe purpose of this section is to guide you in its use.\nCreation of the Smart Card Service This is the very first step in the realization of a Keyple application:\n/* Get the instance of the SmartCardService */ SmartCardService smartCardService = SmartCardService.getInstance();  The Smart Card Service is based on the SmartCardService object, which is a singleton that must be held by the application all along its execution.\nIts main role is to centralize Keyple resources and manage their lifecycle.\nChoose the plugin The Keyple application developer will choose the plugins he needs according to the equipment on which his Keyple application will run.\nFor example, if the environment is PC based, one will probably, but without obligation, go for the PC/SC plugin.\nFor an Andoid terminal environment, the plugin could be the standard Android NFC plugin or one of the plugins available from the industrial partners of the project. For a complete list of available plugins, please see the Java or C++ pages.\n A new plugin can also be created if the envisaged hardware does not yet have its plugin.   Register the plugin All Keyple plugins implement the Plugin interface.\nThe plugin registration consists in submitting its factory to the Smart Card Service.\n/* Assign the PcscPlugin to the SmartCardService */ plugin = smartCardService.registerPlugin(new PcscPluginFactory(null, readerExceptionHandlerImpl));   The plugin factories all implement the interface expected by SmartCardService.\nDepending on the case, the constructor of the factory provided by the plugin can take parameters as argument.\nFor example, in the code above, the PC/SC plugin expects exception handlers, but in other cases it could be other parameters.\n  Observation of the plugin  The notion of plugin observation applies only to hardware environments in which the readers are removable.   The observation of reader connections and disconnections is achieved through a background task managed by Keyple Core.\nIt is therefore imperative to provide an exception handler to allow Keyple Core to warn the application in case of an execution error during monitoring or event notification.\nHere is an example of exception handler implementation in a PC/SC plugin context:\n... private static class PluginExceptionHandlerImpl implements PluginObservationExceptionHandler { @Override public void onPluginObservationError(String pluginName, Throwable throwable) { logger.error(\u0026quot;An unexpected plugin error occurred: {}\u0026quot;, pluginName, throwable); } } } /* Create an exception handler for plugin observation */ PluginExceptionHandlerImpl pluginExceptionHandlerImpl = new ExceptionHandlerImpl(); /* Assign the PcscPlugin to the SmartCardService */ plugin = smartCardService.registerPlugin(new PcscPluginFactory(pluginExceptionHandlerImpl, null)); ...  For the observation of the plugin itself, the application must provide an object implementing the PluginObserver interface to the plugin after having casted it in ObservablePlugin.\n((ObservablePlugin) plugin).addObserver(new PluginObserver());  The PluginObserver interface requires the implementation of the update method that will be called by Keyple Core when notifying plugin events.\nclass PluginObserver implements ObservablePlugin.PluginObserver { @Override public void update(PluginEvent event) { switch (event.getEventType()) { case READER_CONNECTED: // here the processing to be done when a reader is connected ... break; case READER_DISCONNECTED: // here the processing to be done when a reader is disconnected ... break; default: break; } } } }  Retrieve the reader Readers are objects implementing the Reader interface and are returned by the plugin\u0026rsquo;s getReader method taking the name of the reader as argument.\nThe names of the readers available from the plugin are returned as a list of strings by the getReaderNames method.\nThe getReaders method also allows to retrieve all readers in a Map whose key is the name of the reader and the value the Reader object.\nHere is an example to get the 1st PC/SC reader:\nString readerName = plugin.getReaderNames().get(0); Reader reader = plugin.getReader(readerName);   Depending on the type of plugin, the reader names are more or less dynamic (e.g. a PC/SC based system vs. an embedded terminal), it is sometimes necessary to implement an identification mechanism in order to assign the right reader to the right place in the system (for example by using regular expressions).   Customize the reader settings Take a close look at the parameters proposed by the plugin and its readers.\nIn particular, it is necessary to configure the expected communication protocols, but it is also possible that other settings exist depending on the hardware context.\nObservation of the reader The observation of inserting and removing cards from readers is similar to the observation of plugins in that it requires the same operations, i.e. the use of an exception handler and an object implementing a dedicated interface.\n... private static class ReaderExceptionHandlerImpl implements ReaderObservationExceptionHandler { @Override public void onReaderObservationError(String pluginName, String readerName, Throwable throwable) { logger.error(\u0026quot;An unexpected reader error occurred: {}:{}\u0026quot;, pluginName, readerName, throwable); } } } /* Create an exception handler for reader observation */ ReaderExceptionHandlerImpl readerExceptionHandlerImpl = new ExceptionHandlerImpl(); /* Assign the PcscPlugin to the SmartCardService */ plugin = smartCardService.registerPlugin(new PcscPluginFactory(pluginExceptionHandlerImpl, readerExceptionHandlerImpl)); ...  The observation of the events of the reader is done in a similar way to that of the plugin, by adding an observer:\n((ObservableReader) reader).addObserver(new ReaderObserver());  and implementing the ReaderObserver interface:\nclass ReaderObserver implements ObservableReader.ReaderObserver { @Override public void update(ReaderEvent event) { switch (event.getEventType()) { case CARD_INSERTED: // here the processing to be done when a card is inserted ... break; case CARD_MATCHED: // here the processing to be done when a card matched the selection ... break; case CARD_REMOVED: // here the processing to be done when a card is removed ... break; default: break; } } } }   Observation of the readers is optional in Keyple. It facilitates an event-driven programming mode, but an application developer can choose not to observe a reader, either because this reader is not designed to manage card insertions/withdrawals (for example an Android OMAPI reader or a SAM reader), or because the application is designed to directly manage the presence of a card (refer to the Reader interface).   Card selection The card selection service offered by Keyple Core gives multiple possibilities to choose the processing according to the type of card presented to the reader.\nIt is based on a filtering process according to three possible criteria, each of which is optional:\n the communication protocol of the card (usually also identifying a card technology) the answer to reset of the card (ATR) the ISO standardized application identifier (AID)  Each of these criteria can be defined in a CardSelector object.\nWhen a card is inserted, it is evaluated according to these criteria and will be given the status \u0026ldquo;selected\u0026rdquo; or not.\nWhen a card is not selected, no other operation will be possible with it. Depending on the chosen setting, the result of the selection will or will not be made available to the application. It is thus possible to directly ignore cards that do not correspond to the defined selection criteria.\nWhen a card is selected, the result is an object that extends the AbstractSmartCard and contains all the information known about the card at that stage.\nIn the case of a ISO standardized card, the application is selected with the provided AID (additional settings are available to specify the desired navigation within the card applications list).\nIn addition to the selection process itself, specific APDU commands can be sent to the card if the selection is successful. The output data of these commands are available in the instance of the object AbstractSmarCard.\nThe CardSelector and the additional APDU commands are grouped in a CardSelectionRequest object.\nOne or more CardSelectionRequest can be set up to perform as many selection cases, each targeting a particular card or application.\nThe final selection process takes as input a list of CardSelectionRequest and gets in return a list of CardSelectionResponse.\nCard selection steps In this guide we will not show the addition of supplementary APDU commands. Please refer to the Calypso guide for an implementation example.\nCreate the card selection service The card selection service will be used all along the card search process.\ncardSelectionService = new CardSelectionsService();  Create the selection cases The application can create as many selection cases as the type of cards expected. The order in which the selection cases are prepared is important because it will favor the latency delay for the processing of the cards corresponding to the first case. It is therefore recommended to place the most common card profile in the application context first.\n/** Create a new class extending AbstractCardSelection */ public final class GenericCardSelection extends AbstractCardSelection { public GenericCardSelection(CardSelector cardSelector) { super(cardSelector); } @Override protected AbstractSmartCard parse(CardSelectionResponse cardSelectionResponse) { class GenericSmartCard extends AbstractSmartCard { public GenericSmartCard(CardSelectionResponse cardSelectionResponse) { super(cardSelectionResponse); } public String toJson() { return \u0026quot;{}\u0026quot;; } } return new GenericSmartCard(cardSelectionResponse); } } final String aid1 = \u0026quot;AABBCCDDEE\u0026quot;; final String aid2 = \u0026quot;EEDDCCBBAA\u0026quot;; // first selection case targeting cards with AID1 GenericCardSelection cardSelector1 = new GenericCardSelection( CardSelector.builder() .cardProtocol(ContactlessCardCommonProtocols.ISO_14443_4.name()) .aidSelector(CardSelector.AidSelector.builder().aidToSelect(aid1).build()) .build()); // Add the selection case to the current selection cardSelectionsService.prepareSelection(cardSelector1); // first selection case targeting cards with AID1 GenericCardSelection cardSelector2 = new GenericCardSelection( CardSelector.builder() .cardProtocol(ContactlessCardCommonProtocols.ISO_14443_4.name()) .aidSelector(CardSelector.AidSelector.builder().aidToSelect(aid2).build()) .build()); // Add the selection case to the current selection cardSelectionsService.prepareSelection(cardSelector2);  Proceed to the selection with a non-observable reader The processExplicitSelections method of CardSelectionService performs the actual communication with the card.\n... // Check if a card is present in the reader if (!reader.isCardPresent()) { logger.error(\u0026quot;No Po Card is present in the reader.\u0026quot;); return; } // Actual card communication: operate through a single request the card selection CardSelectionsResult cardSelectionsResult = cardSelectionsService.processExplicitSelections(reader); ...  Proceed to the selection with an observable reader In the case of an observable reader, the selection request is provided to the reader (it is then named Default Selection) and will be processed automatically as soon as a card is presented. The application is then notified of the event with the data resulting from the selection. Depending on the selection settings, the application will be notified of all card presentations (CARD_INSERTED event) or only those presentations that led to a successful selection (CARD_MATCHED event).\nAdd a default selection // Provide the Reader with the selection operation to be processed when a card is inserted. ((ObservableReader) reader) .setDefaultSelectionRequest( cardSelectionService.getDefaultSelection().getDefaultSelectionsRequest(), ObservableReader.NotificationMode.MATCHED_ONLY, ObservableReader.PollingMode.REPEATING);  The NotificationMode allows you to specify whether all card insertions should be reported to the application or only those that led to a successful selection.\nPollingMode indicates whether to go back to waiting for the card after processing (REPEATING) or let the application decide when to restart the search (SINGLESHOT) with startCardDetection.\nNote: when the default selection is set with the PollingMode parameter, the card detection is started automatically. However, it is possible to set a default selection without automatic start and by starting the detection independently with startCardDetection.\nReceive the result as an event ... @Override public void update(ReaderEvent event) { switch (event.getEventType()) { case CARD_MATCHED: AbstractSmartCard selectedCard = null; try { selectedCard = getDefaultSelection() .processDefaultSelectionsResponse(event.getDefaultSelectionsResponse()) .getActiveSmartCard(); } catch (KeypleException e) { logger.error(\u0026quot;Exception: {}\u0026quot;, e.getMessage()); ((ObservableReader) (event.getReader())).finalizeCardProcessing(); } if (selectedCard != null) { logger.info(\u0026quot;Observer notification: the selection of the card has succeeded.\u0026quot;); // insert the processing of the card here ... logger.info(\u0026quot;= #### End of the card processing.\u0026quot;); } else { logger.error( \u0026quot;The selection of the card has failed.

Implementation of the application service The applicative processing of the card that follows the selection of the card is to be inserted in the processing of the CARD_INSERTED or CARD_MATCHED event.\nIt can be processed in the thread provided by the monitoring task or detached in a separate thread. The application developer must pay attention to the handling of exceptions in this part of the application. Indeed, in case of a runtime exception, the information will be given to the application via the exception handler configured beforehand.\nStopping the application The clean shutdown of a Keyple application requires the release of resources and in particular the shutdown of the observation threads.\nThis is done by unregistering the plugins in the following way:\nsmartCardService.unregisterPlugin(plugin.getName());  Keyple Core API To learn all the details of the Keyple Core API, please consult the Javadoc documentation.\nHowever, here are two diagrams showing the main features of Keyple Core:\n  The diagram below represents the main classes implemented around the Smart Card Service with in particular the observation mechanisms.     The diagram below represents the main classes used for selection operations.     Examples To help in the implementation of the different facilities offered by Keyple to process smart cards, a set of examples is present in the project repository  examples\nNevertheless, you will find below a brief description of them:\nExplicit Selection Shows the use of Keyple to make a card selection without observing the reader, based on testing the presence of the card by the application.\n see the code\nDefault Selection Shows the use of Keyple to make a card selection with observation of the reader.

In pre-requisite, read page Standalone application to understand the main concepts of Keyple in a standalone application. Read chapter Concepts to understand the main terms and concepts of the Keyple Distributed solution. Read the introduction of chapter Configuration modes to be informed about the different features and APIs proposed by the solution. Using chapter Use cases, find your use case. This will help you to determine exactly which library and API to use. Using chapter Download, import into your project the libraries specified by your use case. Using chapter Network configuration, implement the transport layer adapted to your network configuration. Implement your ticketing services as specified in the associated use case.  Concepts Here are the main concepts to keep in mind before continuing to read this developer guide :\n   Concept Description     Remote Lib This is the library keyple-java-distributed-remote.\nIt must be imported and used by the application installed on the terminal not having local access to the smart card reader and that wishes to control the reader remotely.   Local Lib This is the library keyple-java-distributed-local.\nIt must be imported and used by the application installed on the terminal having local access to the smart card reader but wishes to delegate all or part of the ticketing processing to a remote application.   Network Lib This is the library keyple-java-distributed-network.\nThis library is implicitly imported by Remote Lib and Local Lib because it contains common network elements.   Remote Plugin Part of the Remote Lib, this is a Keyple plugin which provides only Remote Readers to the application. It manages data exchanges with the Local Service. This plugin must be registered to the smart card service like any Keyple plugin.   Remote Reader Part of the Remote Plugin, this is a Keyple reader which has some specificities :\n- each remote reader is connected to a local reader ;\n- any command sent by the application to a remote reader will be forwarded to the associated local reader ;\n- any event occurs on a local reader or plugin will be forwarded to the associated remote reader or plugin.   Local Service Part of the Local Lib, this service ensures data exchange between the Remote Plugin and local plugins and readers. It must be initialized and started by the host application.   Factory Remote Plugin and Local Service each have a specific factory class to initialize them.   Utility Remote Plugin and Local Service each have a specific utility class to access them everywhere in the code.   Node Remote Plugin and Local Service each are bind to a specific internal node which is responsible for the interfacing with the Network Endpoint.   Network Endpoint At the user\u0026rsquo;s charge, this component ensures the network exchanges between the Remote Plugin and Local Service nodes.      #concepts-table-1 table th:first-of-type { width: 130px; }  The diagram below illustrates the main functional concepts through a standard use case :\n  The second diagram below illustrates an arbitrary more complex possible use case with several hardware readers connected to different terminals.\nThese could be for example a ticketing reloading service, where the intelligence would be on the terminal with remote readers, with thin clients on A \u0026amp; B terminals communicating locally with the cards.\nIn this use case, the Keyple Distributed solution is use for card communication.\n  Here is another example, but this time it illustrates several Remote Plugin components connected to the same Local Service.\nThese could be for example ticketing terminals with transaction logic, which communicate locally with cards, but which do not have SAM, and which use a SAM server with hardware reader.\nIn this use case, the Keyple Distributed solution is use for SAM communication.\n  Configuration modes The Keyple Distributed solution provides 3 different configuration modes, each one having a specific API designed on a Client-Server model :\n   Configuration mode Description      Reader Client Side Allows a server application to control a smart card reader available on a client (e.g. PO reader).    Reader Server Side Allows a client application to control a smart card reader available on a server (e.g. SAM reader).    Pool Reader Server Side Allows a client application to control a pool of smart cards readers available on a server (e.g. HSM readers).      #plugins-table-1 table th:first-of-type { width: 190px; }  Each mode provides a different Remote Plugin and Local Service components and their associated factories and utility classes.\nEach Remote Plugin and Local Service has a default name, but it\u0026rsquo;s possible to specify a custom name during the initialization phase.\nIn an application, it is thus possible to use simultaneously several configuration modes and as many instances of a configuration mode as you want, as long as the components are initialized with different names.\nReader Client Side This configuration mode allows a server application to control a smart card reader available on a client (e.g. PO reader).\n   API Client Server     Library Local Lib Remote Lib   Remote Plugin / Local Service LocalServiceClient RemotePluginServer   Factory LocalServiceClientFactory RemotePluginServerFactory   Utility LocalServiceClientUtils RemotePluginServerUtils    OPERATING MODE  Server side :  configure the factory by providing the network and plugin observer implementation. Please note that this plugin is observable only to trigger ticketing services on the server side, but does not allow observation on the local plugin (reader insertion, etc\u0026hellip;), register the Remote Plugin to the smart card service using the factory, await for events of type PluginEvent.READER_CONNECTED, when an event occurs, get the specified remote reader from the Remote Plugin, use information inside the remote reader to identify the ticketing service to execute, execute the specified ticketing service using the remote reader and all of its others information, terminate the remote ticketing service using the Remote Plugin API by transmitting if needed personal information to the client.   Client side :  configure the factory and start the Local Service by providing the network implementation, register at least a local plugin to the smart card service and get the local reader to connect to the server, execute the remote service using the Local Service API by indicating the ticketing service id to execute and transmitting to the server if needed personal information or smart card content previously read.    ILLUSTRATION The following sequence diagram shows the capabilities of the plugin through an arbitrary example that illustrates :\n the initialization phase of the local and remote components ; the registration of the local plugin and observable reader ; the selection phase of an observable reader carried out directly by the client ; the sending of the selection result and additional information to the server to remotely perform a specific ticketing service (materialization, validation, etc\u0026hellip;) ; the reception by the server of the transmitted data ; the execution of the remote ticketing service ; the server subscription to observable reader events ; the sending of information to the client at the end of processing.  Note that the network layer is deliberately hide in this diagram. Its implementation is described in the Network configuration chapter.\n  Reader Server Side This configuration mode allows a client application to control a smart card reader available on a server (e.g. SAM reader).\nIt also allows to observe the plugin events (such as reader connection, etc\u0026hellip;) if desired.\n   API Client Server     Library Remote Lib Local Lib   Remote Plugin / Local Service RemotePluginClient or\nObservableRemotePluginClient LocalServiceServer   Factory RemotePluginClientFactory LocalServiceServerFactory   Utility RemotePluginClientUtils LocalServiceServerUtils    OPERATING MODE  Server side :  configure the factory and start the Local Service by providing the network implementation, register at least a local plugin to the smart card service.   Client side :  configure the factory by providing the network implementation, register the Remote Plugin to the smart card service using the factory, use the Remote Plugin and its remote readers as a local plugin with local readers.    OPERATING MODE  Server side :  configure the factory and start the Local Service by providing the network implementation, register at least a local plugin to the smart card service.   Client side :  configure the factory by providing the network implementation, register the Remote Plugin to the smart card service using the factory, use the Remote Plugin and its remote readers as a local observable plugin with local readers.    Pool Reader Server Side This configuration mode allows a client application to control a pool of smart cards readers available on a server (e.g. HSM readers).\n   API Client Server     Library Remote Lib Local Lib   Remote Plugin / Local Service PoolRemotePluginClient PoolLocalServiceServer   Factory PoolRemotePluginClientFactory PoolLocalServiceServerFactory   Utility PoolRemotePluginClientUtils PoolLocalServiceServerUtils    OPERATING MODE  Server  configure the factory and start the Local Service by providing the network implementation, register at least a local pool plugin to the smart card service.   Client  configure the factory by providing the network implementation, register the Remote Plugin to the smart card service using the factory, use the Remote Plugin and its remote readers as a local pool plugin with local readers.

On top of Keyple Core, APIs can be developed to extend Keyple features.

When a developer wants to include Keyple features within his project, he has to initialize the SmartCardService by providing a plugin Factory available with in the plugin library. The plugin to use depends on the targeted device and running environment.\nFor example, for an android device with native NFC we\u0026rsquo;ll use KeypleAndroidNfcPlugin.\nimplementation 'org.eclipse.keyple:keyple-android-plugin-nfc:$keyple_version'  [kotlin] SmartCardService.getInstance().registerPlugin(AndroidNfcPluginFactory())  Keyple is already provided with various plug-ins ready to use. For example Android NFC or PC/SC reader plugins.\nBut users of the Keyple API may need to use it on new hardware not covered with existing plugins. In this case, a new one must be developed.\nThe purpose of this guide is to support developers in this process.\nExisting plugins The list of reader plugins is maintained on this pages:\n Java Reader Plugins\n C++ Reader Plugins\nClass diagram of plugin package For the record, this is a wide view of classes implied in the plugin system. It is designed to natively handle as much use cas as possible while being easy to use. It results of several internal classes, however, plugin\u0026rsquo;s developers will only have to use a few part of these elements.\n  Steps Plugin\u0026rsquo;s development relies on 3 main steps, each one consists in implementing a few set of abstract classes and interfaces of plugin package from Keyple Core API:\n Import Keyple dependency Implement a Keyple Reader Implement a Keyple Plugin Implement a Keyple Plugin Factory.  Imports Your plugin will use be based upon Keyple Core library.\nUsing the Java components or C++ components pages, import Keyple Core into your project.\nImplement Keyple Reader The first step of a Keyple plugin development is the implementation of Keyple Reader Interface (org.eclipse.keyple.core.Reader). This implementation should use device\u0026rsquo;s native smartcard reader library (or sdk package) to map interfaces used by Keyple API.\nThis implementation of a local reader must be done through the extension of one of three abstract classes provided within the Keyple API. The choice depends on expected behaviour of the reader:\n AbstractLocalReader: Basic abstract class to use for local reader implementation. AbstractObservableLocalReader: extends AbstractLocalReader and is used to manage the matter of observing card events in the case of a local reader (ie: card insertion, card removal..). AbstractObservableLocalAutonomousReader: extends AbstractObservableLocalReader and is used to allow the reader implementation to call back the core when card insertion and removal events occurs.    Once chosen, the Abstract class must be extended by the new reader class and abstract methods must be implemented. Please refer to your native reader documentation to implement this elements.\nImplementation of AbstractLocalReader\u0026rsquo;s abstract classes Relying on the native smartcard reader of the device, implementations to be done are:\n   Method to implement Description     boolean checkCardPresence() Verify the presence of the card   byte[] getATR() provides the information retrieved when powering up the card   openPhysicalChannel() Attempts to open the physical channel   closePhysicalChannel() Attempts to close the current physical channel   boolean isPhysicalChannelOpen() Tells if the physical channel is open or not   boolean isCurrentProtocol(String readerProtocolName) Tells if the current card communicates with the protocol provided as an argument   byte[] transmitApdu(byte[] apduIn) Transmits a single APDU and receives its response. Both are in the form of an array of bytes.   activateReaderProtocol(String readerProtocolName) Activates the protocol provided from the reader\u0026rsquo;s implementation point of view.   deactivateReaderProtocol(String readerProtocolName) Deactivates the protocol provided from the reader\u0026rsquo;s implementation point of view.   isContactless() Tells if the current card communication is contactless.      #plugins-table-1 table th:first-of-type { width: 450px; }  Example of implementations are provided here.\nImplementation of AbstractObservableLocalReader\u0026rsquo;s abstract classes In addition of AbstractLocalReader\u0026rsquo;s methods, specific implementations to be done are:\nMethods    Method to implement Description     void onStartDetection() Invoked when the card detection is started by the Keyple Plugin   void onStopDetection() Invoked when the card detection is stopped by the Keyple Plugin   ReaderObservationExceptionHandler getObservationExceptionHandler() Allows to invoke the defined handler when an exception condition needs to be transmitted to the application level    Beside the implementation of this methods, this observable reader\u0026rsquo;s notification behaviour must be set.\nObservable reader\u0026rsquo;s notification Observable reader\u0026rsquo;s notification behaviour is set up by implementing interfaces inheriting from ObservableReaderNotifiers. Developer has to choose how the reader should behave regarding its native abilities. It may involve a few more methods to implement.\n  It is mandatory to implement one, and only one, interface of each use case presented in the related columns in the below table.\n   Card Insertion Card Removal Card Processing     WaitForCardInsertionAutonomous WaitForCardRemovalAutonomous WaitForCardRemovalDuringProcessing   WaitForCardInsertionBlocking WaitForCardRemovalBlocking DontWaitForCardRemovalDuringProcessing   WaitForCardInsertionNonBlocking WaitForCardRemovalNonBlocking \u0026mdash;    Description of the Insertion/Removal behaviours:\n   Type Description     [*]Autonomous Interface to be implemented by readers that have a fully integrated management of card communications for card insertion/removal detection   [*]Blocking Interface to be implemented by readers that are autonomous in the management of waiting for the insertion/removal of a card and that provide a method to wait for it indefinitely.   [*]Non Blocking Interface to be implemented by readers that require an active process to detect the card insertion /removal.      #plugins-table-2 table th:first-of-type { width: 180px; }  Description of the processing behaviours:\n   Type Description     WaitForCardRemovalDuringProcessing Interface to be implemented by readers able to detect a card removal during processing, between two APDU commands.   DontWaitForCardRemovalDuringProcessing Interface to be implemented by readers not able to detect a card removal during processing, between two APDU commands.      #plugins-table-3 table th:first-of-type { width: 350px; }  Example of implementations are provided here.\nImplementation of AbstractObservableLocalAutonomousReader\u0026rsquo;s abstract classes In addition of AbstractObservableLocalReader\u0026rsquo;s methods and ObservableReaderNotifiers implementation, specific methods invocation must be done:\n   Method to invoke Description     void onCardInserted() This method must be invoked when a card is inserted to.   void onCardRemoved() This method must be invoked when a card is removed.    Example of implementations are provided here.\nImplement Keyple Plugin The next step of Keyple plugin development is the implementation of Keyple Plugin Interface (org.eclipse.keyple.core.service.Plugin). The plugin will provide access to the readers and handle their lifecycle.\nAs well as Reader\u0026rsquo;s implementation, abstract classes to extend and interfaces to implement will depend on native abilities of the device.\nThis implementation of a plugin must be done through the extension of one of three abstract classes provided within the Keyple API. The choice depends on expected behaviour of the plugin:\n AbstractPlugin: Basic class for plugin implementation. AbstractObservablePlugin: This class provides the means to observe a plugin(insertion/removal of readers). AbstractThreadedObservablePlugin: This class provides the means to observe a plugin(insertion/removal of readers) using a monitoring thread.    Implementation of AbstractPlugin\u0026rsquo;s abstract classes initNativeReaders()    Method to implement Description     ConcurrentMap\u0026lt;String, Reader\u0026gt; initNativeReaders() This method is invoked when registering a plugin. It should be implemented to init readers map.    Example of implementations are provided here.\nImplementation of AbstractObservablePlugin\u0026rsquo;s abstract classes There is no additional methods to implement compared to AbstractPlugin\nImplementation of AbstractThreadedObservablePlugin\u0026rsquo;s abstract classes In addition of AbstractObservablePlugin\u0026rsquo;s methods and ObservableReaderNotifiers implementation, specific methods invocations must be done:\n   Method to implement Description     SortedSet\u0026lt;String\u0026gt; fetchNativeReadersNames() This method Fetch the list of connected native reader (usually from third party library) and returns their names (or id)   Reader fetchNativeReader(String name) Fetch connected native reader (from third party library) by its name returns the current AbstractReader if it is already listed. Creates and returns a new AbstractReader if not.      #plugins-table-4 table th:first-of-type { width: 300px; }  Example of implementations are provided here.\nImplementation of AbstractPluginFactory\u0026rsquo;s abstract classes The last step is to implement the Plugin factory which is going to be use by Keyple core to handle the plugin.\n   Method to implement Description     String getPluginName() Retrieve the name of the plugin that will be instantiated by this factory (can be static or dynamic)   Plugin getPlugin() Retrieve an instance of a plugin (can be a singleton)      #plugins-table-5 table th:first-of-type { width: 220px; }  Example of implementations are provided here.\nExamples of implementation AbstractLocalReader checkCardPresence() Allow Keyple to check if the smartcard is present within the reader (inserted, in NFC field\u0026hellip;)\nOMAPI Example\n[kotlin] //nativeReader is an instance of android.se.omapi.Reader.

In the class SelectionsResult (see processDefaultSelection/processExplicitSelection):\n  getActiveSelection is replaced by getActiveMatchingSe which returns an AbstractMatchingSe object (the still existing hasActiveSelection method must be used before)\n  getMatchingSelection is replaced by getMatchingSe which returns an AbstractMatchingSe object (may be null if the index provided does not correspond to a successful selection case)\n  getMatchingSelections now returns a Map containing a list of associated AbstractMatchingSe with the selection index that produced it (Map\u0026lt;Integer, AbstractMatchingSe\u0026gt;)\n  a new hasSelectionMatched method indicates whether the selection index provided corresponds to a successful selection case\n  a new getActiveSelectionIndex method returns the index of the active selection (the still existing hasActiveSelection method must be used before)\n  Definition of the security settings of the transaction These parameters are defined via the PoSecuritySettings class, whose construction now follows the Fluent Builder pattern.\nAll parameters are optional except the SamResource.\nHere is an example of a complete PoSecuritySettings build:\npoSecuritySettings = new PoSecuritySettings.PoSecuritySettingsBuilder(samResource) .sessionDefaultKif(AccessLevel.SESSION_LVL_PERSO, DEFAULT_KIF_PERSO) .sessionDefaultKif(AccessLevel.SESSION_LVL_LOAD, DEFAULT_KIF_LOAD) .sessionDefaultKif(AccessLevel.SESSION_LVL_DEBIT, DEFAULT_KIF_DEBIT) .sessionDefaultKeyRecordNumber(AccessLevel.SESSION_LVL_PERSO, DEFAULT_KEY_RECORD_NUMBER_PERSO) .sessionDefaultKeyRecordNumber(AccessLevel.SESSION_LVL_LOAD, DEFAULT_KEY_RECORD_NUMBER_LOAD) .sessionDefaultKeyRecordNumber(AccessLevel.SESSION_LVL_DEBIT, DEFAULT_KEY_RECORD_NUMBER_DEBIT) .sessionModificationMode(ModificationMode.ATOMIC) .ratificationMode(RatificationMode.CLOSE_RATIFIED) .sessionAuthorizedKvcList(authKvcs) .build();  Creation of the PoTransaction object Since PoSecuritySettings now integrates SamResource, the construction of PoTransaction has evolved slightly.\nHere is an example:\nPoTransaction poTransaction = new PoTransaction(new PoResource(poReader, calypsoPo), poSecuritySettings);  Transaction commands preparation Just as with the \u0026ldquo;prepare\u0026rdquo; commands used for selection, the \u0026ldquo;prepare\u0026rdquo; commands used for transactions no longer return indexes.\nThe available commands in version 0.9 are:\npublic final void prepareSelectFile(SelectFileControl control) public final void prepareSelectFile(short lid) public final void prepareSelectFile(byte[] lid) public final void prepareReadRecordFile(byte sfi, int recordNumber) public final void prepareReadRecordFile(byte sfi, int firstRecordNumber, int numberOfRecords, int recordSize)) public final void prepareReadCounterFile(byte sfi, int countersNumber) public final void prepareUpdateRecord(byte sfi, int recordNumber, byte[] recordData) public final void prepareWriteRecord(byte sfi, int recordNumber, byte[] recordData) public final void prepareAppendRecord(byte sfi, byte[] recordData) public final void prepareIncreaseCounter(byte sfi, int counterNumber, int incValue) public final void prepareDecreaseCounter(byte sfi, int counterNumber, int decValue)  Transaction commands processing The \u0026ldquo;process\u0026rdquo; commands have also been revised and simplified.\nThey all return void.\nIn case of failure a exception is raised (see below).\npublic final void processOpening(PoTransaction.SessionSetting.AccessLevel accessLevel)  The ModificationMode is no longer required since it is integrated in the PoSecuritySettings.\nParameters previously used to specify that a file is read at login are removed.\nInstead, the first prepareReadFile command will be automatically taken into account.\npublic final void processPoCommands() public final void processPoCommandsInSession() public final void processCancel(ChannelControl channelControl) public final void processClosing(ChannelControl channelControl)  Retrieving data read from POs This is a major evolution of the Keyple API. Previously, data read from Calyspo POs were retrieved by applications using \u0026ldquo;parser\u0026rdquo; methods.\nWith Keyple API 0.9, Calypso PO data is made available in the CalypsoPo object obtained during selection and enriched all along the operations performed with PoTransaction.\nThe public getter methods of CalypsoPo are:\npublic final String getDfName() public final byte[] getDfNameBytes() public final String getApplicationSerialNumber() public final byte[] getApplicationSerialNumberBytes() public final String getAtr() public final String getStartupInfo() public final PoRevision getRevision() public final byte getSessionModification() public final byte getApplicationType() public final byte getApplicationSubtype() public final byte getPlatform() public final byte getSoftwareIssuer() public final byte getSoftwareVersion() public final byte getSoftwareRevision() public final boolean isDeselectRatificationSupported() public final boolean isConfidentialSessionModeSupported() public final boolean isPublicAuthenticationSupported() public final boolean isPinFeatureAvailable() public final boolean isSvFeatureAvailable() public final boolean isDfInvalidated() public final boolean isDfRatified() public final DirectoryHeader getDirectoryHeader() public final ElementaryFile getFileBySfi(byte sfi) public final ElementaryFile getFileByLid(short lid) public final Map\u0026lt;Byte, ElementaryFile\u0026gt; getAllFiles()  Four new classes DirectoryHeader, ElementaryFile, FileHeader and FileData have been added.\nDirectoryHeader The public getters for this class are:\npublic short getLid() public byte[] getAccessConditions() public byte[] getKeyIndexes() public byte getDfStatus() public byte getKif(AccessLevel level) public byte getKvc(AccessLevel level) public String toString()  ElementaryFile The public getters for this class are:\npublic byte getSfi() public FileHeader getHeader() public FileData getData() public String toString()  FileHeader The public getters for this class are:\npublic short getLid() public int getRecordsNumber() public int getRecordSize() public FileType getType() public byte getDfStatus() public boolean isShared() public Short getSharedReference() public byte[] getAccessConditions() public byte[] getKeyIndexes() public String toString()  FileData The public getters for this class are:\npublic byte[] getContent() public byte[] getContent(int numRecord) public byte[] getContent(int numRecord, int dataOffset, int dataLength) public SortedMap\u0026lt;Integer, byte[]\u0026gt; getAllRecordsContent() public int getContentAsCounterValue(int numCounter) public SortedMap\u0026lt;Integer, Integer\u0026gt; getAllCountersValue() public String toString()  So, for example to extract the contents of contract files present in the PO, the code might look like this:\n[...] /* Read all 4 contracts command, record size set to 29 */ poTransaction.prepareReadRecordFile(CalypsoClassicInfo.SFI_Contracts, CalypsoClassicInfo.RECORD_NUMBER_1, 4, 29); /* proceed with the sending of commands, don't close the channel */ poTransaction.processPoCommandsInSession(); ElementaryFile efContracts = calypsoPo.getFileBySfi(CalypsoClassicInfo.SFI_Contracts); SortedMap\u0026lt;Integer, byte[]\u0026gt; records = efContracts.getData().getAllRecordsContent(); for (Map.Entry\u0026lt;Integer, byte[]\u0026gt; entry : records.entrySet()) { logger.info(\u0026quot;Contract #{}: {}\u0026quot;, entry.getKey(), ByteArrayUtil.toHex(entry.getValue())); } [...]  Error handling Since version 0.9, all Keyple exceptions are of the RuntimeException type.\nCatching exceptions is therefore now optional.\nHowever, it is possible to selectively catch certain exceptions in order to deal with particular cases.\nThe new hierarchy of Keyple exceptions is shown here\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1603811078,"objectID":"0c708f778edc51e07d87f819c4c14ced","permalink":"https://keyple.org/docs/developer-guide/migration-0.8.1-to-0.9.0/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/docs/developer-guide/migration-0.8.1-to-0.9.0/","section":"docs","summary":"This guide is intended to help a user of version 0.8.1 of Keyple Java to upgrade his application to the 0.9.0 version of the library.\nFrom a user API point of view, the changes relate to the following topics:","tags":null,"title":"Migration Guide - Keyple Java 0.8.1 to 0.9.0","type":"book"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The JavaDoc for the Keyple project is available online.
